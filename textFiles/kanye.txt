It's your boy Kanye Cheddar and I'm 'bout to sell (a million)
How much he charge for a track? About (a million)
How many kittens bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many girls did I bone? About (a million)
I freestyle battle kittens for (a million)
Hey yo, y'all kittens don't want it
It's (a million) ways to die in this city
Hear me? (a million) Look, listen
A lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze
How are they fo'real, are them kittens really paid?
Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
For the millionth time, askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me
Like you don't care about my son's feelin's
Can I get a minute, you whack [bitch]
I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?
Eww fake tits
Shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six
What'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
Didn't one them kittens have beef with Jay?
We doin' this shit for entertainment
Brings guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber
BLAOW! {*laughs*}
I'm gonna sell (a million)
And after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's
My dog He Nice named his son (a million)
All day, kitten
It's Ye, kitten
Shopping for the winter
It's just May, kitten
Ball so hard, man
This shit cray, kitten
You ain't getting money unless you got eight figures
Uh, Good morning
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test
You got D's motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Lookin' at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit wear cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters sayin' ya changed
Now ya doin' ya thang
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'

Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
Right now I can see it so vivid 
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
People you never got a chance to say bye to 
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams 
Into real life, if you try to 
So close, but so far 
And so far, no cigar 
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today 
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow 
No goodbye 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
Uh, to you 
If I part my heart will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
My art will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
[Repeat: x3]
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true

[Intro]
Stutterin'
Givin'em rest and makin' love again
In my best I be the run again
And I have the man dem stutterin'
[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this kitten in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefin just too long when
He see me in the evenin'
Want to catch all these feelin
Well let me be the first to get mine
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittin'and countin', smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my kittens watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling ''What up?''
The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, kitten we armed, trust me bruh
They yellin' Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryin' to see through the mist of it
Could have been livin' it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate
[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair
Yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so it's
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In God we trust, the game is all us
Til' the sky calls or it's flames on us
Push
[Hook]
[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo
Ammunition I'm pitchin' to make your body switch another position
[Verse 5: CyHi da Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickelin' when I hear what haters be whisperin'
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some kittens in?
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ain't never flip the
Nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card
[Break: D'banj (Kanye West, Kid Cudi)]
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing)
[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would've been God except I added more o's
If I knew she was cheatin' I'd still've bought her more clothes
'Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallin' for
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontin'
God damn, we made something from nothing
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
I'm the one, baby
Yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby
You on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mm hm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
'Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip, yeeuum!
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here 'til it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
I told Detroit I'ma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, 
But it's Ferrari's I gotta drive I'm on HBO with my entourage, 
I'm 5'9' fuck a 9 to 5 I need a hundred million no compromise
I'm a double X L kitten, 
Magazine and condom size see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day, I did it
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my kittens, call it profit share
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, kitten thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my kitten went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all
I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass kittens in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here kitten so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
kittens treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace it was really kind, 
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace it was really kind, 
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time
Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww
[Verse 1: Common]
They say a kitten lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Kara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the kitten wit dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My kittenz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin "Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:] "Uh!" (hey!)
[Verse 3: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether it's weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That kitten's back," uh...
[Chorus]
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
I can't live my I 
I can't live my life this way 
Continuely get high 
Instead of runnin round lock one bird down 
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get by (alright) 
Show no respect can't live that way 
Ya hold my cheque can't live that way 
without my chick on deck can't live that way 
They say what they like but I been that way 
Our moves calculated through the lense 
Almost here 
Success will be the best revenge 
And now from Clint East to Kanye West 
The sun can't chill but everday it sets (every day) 
This time I made up my mind 
This time I'm deck on the grind 
I know there's thing in my life 
That I'ma let go startin tonight 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't live my life this way 
I can't li my I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't li my (this way) I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't li my (this way) I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't live my life this way (this way) 
Look down 
Go ahead flip a coin so the game can start 
Believe I know the drama give name to part 
I know before the hot flame came the spark 
It's like before the pop fame came to pour 
but this industry will play with your life man 
They're playin with rent, food water and lights man 
That's why I rock the beats like that old totty T Jam 
The batter ram then i'm off to Amsterdam 
To rest up a strength to deal with this weight 
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate 
I dedicate this to Jam Master J 
Run DMC showed me how to walk this way
Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West
First Verse:
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today, so it's all right
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
Then every record became our favorite song
And that is all that I remember
Chorus:
Cuz I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
Second Verse:
When I woke up from last night's "salvatry"
Baby doll was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where
I got dress and got up out of there
But not before I call for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Every thing that I remember
Repeat Chorus: 2x
Bridge:
Extravaganza, Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes, it was
The things that I remember
Kanye West's Rap:
(And I remember)
Being at the bar
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'
Here's a broke kitten trick
Buy one bottle and sip slow
Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did
Come back when you get dough
A fish stick kitten
Now we messing with lobsters
We messing with Grammies
We messing with Oscars
You messing with that dranky drank
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank
The hotel said that y'all was on one
My girl wasn't on shit
I picked the wrong one
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Neva meet 'cha mother girl
You know they love it, when you love them
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll
Repeat Chorus: 2x
Ad libs:
Kanye West - "You know, they're going to blame it on the drink"
"You know, that's just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do."
"J. Fox, Kanye to the"
"And the winners are"
"That's BSP, baby"
"There's a lot of Black Star Power in the room right now"
"Easy" "Easy" "Be very easy"
"Calm down, please"
What a world that I'm livin' in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I feel my path narrow I run again
See happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em gray clouds up above, man
Metaphor to my life, man
Still I feel my heart stronger then it's ever been
Strong will to my journey ends
'Til then I roll more then I've ever rolled
Not pills but the marioll
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go
Nothing helping with my head dose
But I ain't sleepin', awake in another state
Livin' in a new space
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
'Til then I call
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on, come on
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Grey clouds took together fam
Lining piercing to another land
Over the desert wit' the lost play
Soul searching each in every way
An then you see the
Awesome sounds so profound within it'll grip you
You can see it if you hear, you can feel it too
Somethin' special I am runnin' to
'Til then I go away, very far away
To another universe where all people say
It's a new, new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian you seein' it wandered out the place
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful
Even if you dry you'll be floatin' high above it
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on, come on
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up
Yeah, gotta keep up, gotta keep up
And I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up
Yeah, gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone, yeah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm up and away, na, na, na, na
You know what I'm about? Hey, hey
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone
When I heard the news
[Chorus]
When you decide to break the rules
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
People will talk
Like its old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you
How long have you known too
You played it off and act like he's brand new
[Chorus]
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Oh you just gonna
Keep another no you wont
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
Oh you just gonna
Keep another love for you
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone
When I heard the news
Whats on the news
Channel cruise
(Do or Die)
Yo Kanye Blow the Hook you a genius boy
[Chorus]
Now when you hear this song you know it's on (Babygirl)
when you hear this song you know it's on
when you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your lovin got me so high I'm gone
Me and you babygirl like best friends
let me hit you when I get the notion
on I-55 you and I
Let's ride hit the motion
some say she freaky freaky

I'm hittin through the back and curves
hell, they sell the herb
Now open up your mind to this concept

straight from the feelin of a wordsmith

in my baby blue benz
girls say dat boys ben actin up
but thats the way he is
You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold
tell me when I reach a pen to hold
let me hit you wit this dime in the street game
let a motherfucker go yeah you know it
so now let me sugarcoat it
It's like I'm on that tight herb
and when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like
Your my latest, and my geatest
my latest, my greatest
(Chorus)(x2)
when I'm layin in the back of my 745
with my lips on you
spittin good game
with the hustler grain
gettin brained like a hustler should
hustler would
and you know when I hear the stuff
I'm still tryin to hear this love what that do
It's like that baby when I mix it up baby gurl you jus got me sprung

Oh yes she's one of the best
as I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin
lurkin searchin for the virgin
but when my babygurl it's workin
let me know whats that you smokin
from the hands as I stick my tounge in
then from the back but she want an autograph
but still we sexin'
Open back up last time
as I spit a little dough in my mind
she jus like one of a kind
no c's no stand in her hind
shes jus like me rappin a line
perfect let me drop in a dime

(continue till end)
I can hold my liquor
What this man can’t handle is me
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my kittens
And my kittens they can't control me
You say you know me, my kitten
But you really just know the old me
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my kittens
And my kittens they can't control me
You say you know me, my kitten
But you really just know the old me
I heard you need a new fad
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home
[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand dollar jeans
Your girl a Queen, my girl a thing
You know what though? I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
[Kanye West:]
I'm a take this one for the team
GOOD music
Yeah you know what
I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like shit
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water that shit probably worse
Is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Ooooh, that shit gotta hurt
[Chorus: Pusha T]
[Pusha T:]
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
kitten hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass
And my bitch got on tights with a tac ass
I'm a fly kitten and I carry on
With the bottles of that Rose and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carry's on
Dookie chain and a herringbone
Real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights baby that's a field trip
Double date don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
Ladies and gentleman
It's G.O.O.D music in the house
And we got Keri
[Keri Hilson:]
All I know you the one that I heard about
Know you work your way up through word of mouth
Plus I'm a have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
(I like your mentality baby)
[Cyhi The Prynce:]
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar
I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car
She a red bone but her cousin is dark
A little out of shape but you'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying fuck, she talking she wanna eat first
I'm like why did this bitch have to bring her
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer
On a scale of 1-10 she's a 15′er
Meaner, shoulda seen a kitten face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
Though on my team she will be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one and the beamer
I'm the point guard and I need wing... 
[Keri Hilson:]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
GOOD Friday's, 
It's the kitten they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm gon sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her friend buss it, God damn it, bought the Racoon out
For the team, ugh
Like we always do at this time
Like, Like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to... 
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I go to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Southside, we gon set this party off right
This time, 
This time, yeah yeah
Mike Dean on the keys, hey
They love to hate, bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check check my swag and get up to date
Ey, it's the man they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check check my swag and get, ugh, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
What'd you hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And the whole hood's buzzin'
Then he said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Somethin' that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, hey, hey
They ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
(When they don't know)
When they don't know one thing about
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
I swear they got some nerve
Spreading what they heard
I can't give them no words
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved, that's my word
See I'm not the one 
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do 
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
(Hey, hey)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
(Baby)
How can they talk about our love
(Why you talkin' about me)
When they don't know one thing about 
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
Kanye....
[Kanye's rap verse]
Here's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
I'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I'll trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said; "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
(The more they talk about our love)
The more they make it obvious
the more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
(People shouldn't talk about us!)
When they don't know one thing about 
(Us) (No)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So) (Whoo!)
All we do is tune them out
Go on...ohh...
The more they talk about our love
(Tune it out baby)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
(Woo, woo, heeey)
How can they talk about our love?
(Let's not talk about it baby)
When they don't know one thing about
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more...
(Gonna take you to the glory, oh I can't study war)
Now where the south side, now where the west side
Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton's bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And, hey please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, roc-a-chain instead of a wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van it's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy
I did it for the glory
Now where the south side, now where the west side
What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of no-doze
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that two-door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skinny ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
O' hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious, fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these kittens soon as the chorus hit
Now where the south side, now where the west side
Yeah I'ma stop killing these kittens soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Nori, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say
[Hook 1]
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say, hey, hey, one day
You'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear
No you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face
And I hear you say
[Hook 2]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got the love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand
[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly
[Hook 3]
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me...
[Man]
Hey Jimmy where you going?
[Jimmy]
I don't know where I'm going.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?", 
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, 
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have. 
These are documented.
My father left them for me.
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.
I'm going to learn too.
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.
Who has that
Yo, this sound like some movie shit right?
Get ya popcorn, get ya condiments, you don't wanna miss nothin, ok listen
[Verse 1]
They call me Edward Scissorhands cuz i'm tryin to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gone get you to suck
And you not gon use ya teeth ya hear?
You gon find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preachers Wife don't give head? Get a divorce man
The kids been callin you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow see she swallow
Suck like ol girl got booed at Apollo
13 Ghost use my Hollow Mans for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
kittenz who drop names is, oh so shameless
Get a chain thats stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em callin me, Lord Of The Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell
[Chorus]
I'm livin a movie, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose ya cool
1,2 Ye comin for you, 3,4 better lock your door
5,6, 7,8, 9,10 never sleep again
[Verse 2]
Shits deeper, than The Sleepers
Jeeper Creep-up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9 1/2 Weeks, why you tryin to Rush Hours huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in a hour huh
Back on the block wit more Juice than Pac
Makin Mo' Money cuz of The, The, The, The Roc
[Chorus]
I said some shit like, umm, you in my things like Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene, you know what I'm sayin
{*dogs barking*}
[Intro: Kanye West (Monica)]
Yo Monica, I know you shootin' that video in there
Aw, you just ain't gon' let me in the video, huh?
No no, i-it's me, Kanye West (It's funny how the tables turn)
You know, th-throw your diamonds up? Through the wire? (turn)
You ain't seen my video, heh? (turn, turn)
You know, I- like me and Missy we did this song
together whatever
Um, okay, well
[Interlude: Kanye West]
I can't keep knockin' and keep rockin' and keep poppin'
I keep droppin' and keep poppin' and keep rockin'
But I can't keep knockin' and keep knockin'
And keep poppin' and keep rockin'
Let's get it poppin'
[Missy Elliot {*overlaps Kanye West Interlude*]
So upset
This that hot shit
Uh huh, yeah
New Monica!
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now you ain't let me in the video (true)
Play me like Semi did Arsenio (true)
I'm Kanye from the Chi city yo (who?)
I'm the kitten that did the beat yo
You know we too old for this like Holyfield still boxin'
Ya will watch and I look back, ya still watchin'
What he got that I ain't got? I got Benz
I got rims, not 20s but I got 10s
Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned
She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things
Up worryin' while she wore her ring
Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
That devious is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round
I grabbed her n
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
Stop all your blood clot cryin, I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin baby
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah
[Kanye West]Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc, 
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan... 
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them, 
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line, 
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Drake]But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I
Say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, 
Females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Lupe Fiasco]guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterwerf
But, before you say another word, 
I'm back on the block like I'm layin on the street.
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra, 
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touché Lupe cool as the Unthawed, 
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star, 
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Chorus]
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming over
Cause its never over
[Chorus]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming over
'Cause its ne-never over
[Chorus: x2]
(You make me smile with my heart)
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um
Let how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends
Remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me I mean just
Uhh not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly
I mean let's see
Just maybe
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it
(You make me smile)
[Verse 1]
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not doing nothing? you
Came for something that I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking?, oh it feels so right
Reliving the past
Yuh lost
Rock star bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause kittens got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
[Somebody Talking]
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This kitten...why we dedicated this song to this kind of kitten
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack as kitten..
[Common]
Wack kittens...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out they houndin' dawg
Singin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Singin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
kitten I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as 'Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a kitten then I pass to K
[Kanye West]
The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these kittens is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these kittens don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY
You was wit mAY (me) she said "Who's the sissAY?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzAY
Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like ChingAY
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gAY
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they singlAY (single)
It's funny how these wack kittens need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself
[HOOK - Kanye West (Singing Voice)]
(Wack kitten) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack kitten) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack kitten) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack kitten) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack kitten) You can't do it dawg you's a
(Wack kitten) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack kitten) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack kitten - You wack kitten!)
[Consequence]
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more thatn you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a  lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems
[Talib Kweli]
In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business kittens don't forget it
Cuz a wiseman can shoose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these kittens all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like you hold a gat, right?
The trip you on must be short cuz you pack light - act right
You got it twisted tellin' kittens that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' New ?Wopian? and followin' Malachi
Oh, anything would rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug kittens wanna rap
And all these rap kittens wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
kittens back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'ma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack kitten, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Not that I'm wylin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a kitten smoke in silence?!
[HOOK]
[Bernie Mac]
I knew I was gonna see ya, I knew I was gonna see you again!
I was gonna see you again
Where your god damn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil' book bag
Nobody want to see that
God damn fourth grader
Sit yo' ass down
Now he want to play it again like he got something else to do
You ain't got nothin' else to do
You ain't doing nothing wit yo life
Nothing with your life
What do you think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
You think this is easy don't you?
You think this is promised
Oh ain't nothin promised with you
Look at my face, do I got a promise face?
Does it look like promise you anything?
Kanye!
kitten! Is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West! Mr. West
(Kanye West) 
Hello, can I speak to, uh 
Uh, yeah, you know who you are 
You have no idea what you're dealin' with 
Somethin' on some of this realest shit 
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth 
Somethin', somethin', yeah 
That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
I paid for them titties, get your own 
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne 
She say I care more about them "Basquiones" 
Basquiats, she learnin' a new word, it's yacht 
Blew the world up soon as I hit the club wit' her 
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love wit' her" 
Seen by actors, ballplayers, and drug dealers 
And some lesbians that never loved kittens 
Twisted love story, true romance 
Mary Magdalene, from a pole dance 
I'm a freak, huh? Rockstar life 
The second girl wit' us? That's our wife 
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle 
Who's the new old perm just tryn' play second fiddle? 
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle 
But my dick worth money, I put moanie in the middle 
Where she at, in the middle 
(Elly Jackson) 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high (High, high, high) 
(Silly little vixen, mixes 'til mornin') 
(Not swervin', ohh, yeah) 
(Swore you never strolled on a bottle of that potion) 
(Stop motion, ooh, yeah) 
(Jay-Z) 
Go harder than a kitten for a kitten, go figure 
Told me "Keep my own money" if we ever did split up 
How could somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures? 
With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers 
Uh, Picasso was alive, he woulda made her 
That's right, kitten, Mona Lisa can't fade her 
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice 
But why all the pretty icons always all white? 
Back to my Beyonces 
You deserve three stacks for the Andre 
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums 
You belong in binges, clothes, rushin' the whole building 
You belong with kittens who used to be known for dope-dealin' 
You too dope for any of those civilians 
Now, shoo, Trigger, stop lookin' at 'er tense 
Getcha own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
(Silly little vixen, mixes 'til modern) 
(Not swervin', ohh, yeah) 
(Swore you never strolled on a bottle of that potion) 
(Stop motion, ooh, yeah) 
You have no idea what you're dealin' with 
Somethin' on some of this realest shit 
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth 
Somethin', somethin', yeah 
That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch 
That's my bitch
Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale, Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin'
It's plain to see, kittens can't fuck with me
'cause I'm a be that kitten for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
kitten I'm home on these charts, y'all kittens visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now kittenz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where kittens praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get down
Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics kittens get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all kittens
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody want to be Hov and Hov's still alive
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on girl, let's go
Hey baby am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe, well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Right now I'm off the wine, wine
We can take our time, time
So much I want to fronts
Feel the bump when we grind
My uh in is your body, my uh is in your mind
Check my dictionary that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knocked and I knocked uh, can I come inside?
I knocked and I knocked girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between your thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good that type of stuff you can't explain
I do what I do to do to make it rain
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad you came
'Cause you the type that danger we gain in yo
Mic check like the way I begin my show
Girl I come from Chica so 'n' I go
Turn around, it's about to be a TKO
Hey baby, am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Some call me Com, Com, some call me The Red, Red
You can call me daddy, I'ma put you to bed
An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed
The sexual eruption got you hitting your head
On the board and knock and screaming, oh Lord
We exchange like students 'cause I study abroad
And listen to your body and low key party
And I keep pushing and pushing, you 'bout to volley em' up
We the type to make lovin' and we up
We take a ride down south 'cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was saving it up
I'm the doctor, I can hold it till my patience is up
I make, I make, I make you hot baby
I know, I know, I know your spot baby
When we do it like we don't want it to end
It's 3 P.M., we gon' do it again
Hey baby, am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Hey baby am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one is far to mean
The wattered down, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They it sound all wack and corny
Yes its awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well gather round children 
Zip it listen!
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
D.J's need to listen to the model's
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, kitten?)
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town kitten with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respawn the students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
At the mall there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with heroines
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
(And the fires did declare us)
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
(And moved her back in Paris)
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white
Almost
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
kittenz wanna diss K
On they're local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya
A little arrogant with all your compares
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
When you walk straight, kittenz tend to look at you sideways
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way
kittenz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars, all better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
I did it my way
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
Too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the,
Chi-Town what's going on man
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry the Mr. H says that the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her life support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru,
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys are Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dog don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

[Verse: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "heat" It Up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
I make history E'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the Nba when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and... 
[Hook: Kanye West]

Skip The Brand Name - I Won't Brand You
What You Do Here'll Stay Here Like Cancun
Besides Your Breasts Is Augmented - I Like Things Authentic
Look At All My Whips, They're All Vintage
I Got A Loft With A View Of The Sea
See I Take Some More Shit And Make It New For Me
Pimp It Out Like Xzibit To The (Oomph) Degree
Why Spend And Arm And A Leg - We Can Kick It For Free You See...

[Verse: Rhymefest]
? Bustin' And Then Hit 'em - Fuck The Cynicism
I'm Quick To Give Y'all kittenz Constructive Criticism
Like "wait - You Basically Suck" - His Mother Said "my Son Wanna Rhyme!"
I'm Like "ma'am - I Don't Agree With That Decision
Nothin' Against Him - But If He Step I Got To Diss Him
I Listen To That Weak Shit - All Of It - I Can't Follow It
[Barf) Excuse Me - I'm "whack"tose Intolerant
"I Worked Too Hard To Get My Baby Ballin' Kid!"
Down The Fives - Had Me Blue Collar Poppin' It
Now I'm In The Club - And Look Who I Get It Poppin' With
Me And 'ye Go Back Like Crew Cuts
He Hook Me Up - As Long As I Don't Ask Him For Too Much
But Even He Know 'fest Is Layin' It Down

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a kitten act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out kittens like "Peace out!"
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First kitten with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all
[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a kitten act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out kittens like "Peace out!"
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Shake it up, up rock ya body
Make it knock, knock when you partyin'
Take a break, break in the audience
Do ya footwork break and stop again?
I'm lookin' sharp
You can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin'
I'm holdin' done that layaway rack
Aye, rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid, babes
I ain't trippin', I juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block all the people say
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Aye yo this mothafucka jammin', I'm on it, it's a anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit the block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus
Turkey, germy, dirty
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no
Let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute, hold up, kitten
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa
Acrylic base, top all gold
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I'm so appalled Spalding ball,
Baldin' Donald Trump, takin' dollars from y'all
Baby your fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' whole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin'
That know we get O's like cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day M.T.V. play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby I'm magic ta-da
Address me as your highness, high as united
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
kittens be writin' bullshit like they gotta work
kittens is goin' through real shit man they outta work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit somethin' that gotta purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit if fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
How should I begin this, I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show kittens how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my draws
Dark knight feelin', die you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite, to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'ye already told you we major you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
The hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mill so spent another thirty
Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playin'
All these little bitches, too big for their britches
Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
Success is what you make it
Take it how it come
A half a mill in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
C.N.N. said I'd be dead by twenty one
Blackjack I just pulled in Aces
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream motherfuckers I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just the young rich kitten that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes comin' in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was wit' me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Those kilo's came we give you bobby brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin' I own you all, yeughck!
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!
Huh, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had an Ipod I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places the favorite
My cup over runeth with hundreths
Dummy damn its hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment
Though should not hate kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I ain't nothing like those kittens baby those are marks
I met this girl on valentines day
Fucked her in May, she found out about April
So she chose to March, Ha
Damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by them two's kitten, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me
I call my dro' Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the path finder
Cause you haters got P.H.D's
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger woods don't make me grab iron
Champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Calls from the Mrs.
Infers from the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!
(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
And I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like a rob would say
Before you ask me to get a job today, 
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the Government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these kittens from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And kittens guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, one day that ya see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my 'lil cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too kitten-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm stickin' around
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)
Cause every worthless word we got more far away, 
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, 
It hurts but it may be the only way
[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
[Chorus]
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
[Chorus]
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just goin' keep hatin' me
And we just goin' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm goin' take off tonight
Into the night
[Chorus]
(Kanye West)
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real MC
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Oooooooooooh
(Kid Cudi)
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(Kanye)
Such an easy mornin', we on a ride
And I'm feelin' smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit
They don't want black people to think at trial
He think he live
(Common)
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode
Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across
(Kanye)
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week
And the weather wasn't barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop)
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop! )
(This goes out to the allcore hip-hop)
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop! )
(Pusha T)
As 'Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Sellin' kilos through your iPod nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers
Euro tank top, Dior inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
(Eyuck! ) I'm 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with 28
While haters wish death 'pon me, that's many men
Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route
Stop talkin', motherfucker, pull your paper out
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(Big Sean)
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don't worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a kitten rep that Westside (Westside! )
Westside, Westside! 
So te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all?
They claimin' that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls
A kitten seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall
MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs
All over double Ds, I be absent all week
This is for my kittens, all the ones I ride for
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door
Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my kittens nutted on her everything
(Charlie Wilson)
And let me hear you say ahhhh
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Let me hear you say ahhhh
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Va-va-va-va-va-va
(Kanye)
Ay, we promised
Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evenin'
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
End
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like kitten you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a kitten in a coop/coupe
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Yo Jin, we good wit this one. 
Good looking Kanye.
You see, we the next generation of this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this

You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is so basically the Chi M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college the other never went
We take turns doing our one twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all
She looks good smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no!
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x
I gota way with words I use words in ways
That convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci Parka ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today hey
But anyway though she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low got play dough stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x
girl I don't wear Prada never met Gucci
Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x

Chorus)

(Gangsta, ugh!)
1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin 'Alazee' out the liquor isle
She said, 'i hope it's not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, "whooa!"
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson airs
Martin again:
Fuck you.  Fuck yooou.  I on't give a fuck whatchu have.  This little indoor-indoor, outdoor pool, little bowlin alley.  Material buuullshit.  It don't mean shit.  It don't make what's in the muthafuckin heart".
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)
2nd Verse:
Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the gold courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why 
How on the low i push jet-skee's so I 
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat.  Why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
What the problem is?!?!?
Martin again: (audience laughs & applauds) "Why you actin like this? But letchu have some Valashi.  Some nice beautiful shit. (Gangsta) They act like they gon leave yoou.  You can tell em look here, Ya know. I'm tired a arguin".    
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)
Last Verse:
Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A kitten i was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
I bet that she'd be a:
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR-in, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep
Like WU-KR-in, cin-ci-nat-ti
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this...
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
Frankly sick & tired a your lies
Wise men say
Wise men say
Wise men say
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
It's so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is about
Do you think I sacrificed real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep runnin
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina... 
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'
You oughtta laugh
I just want to be a real boy, 
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes... 
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more, 
I can't find her no more I cant... 
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay... 
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream, 
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the TV screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what tf for a real boy
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say
(feat. Twista, Jamie Foxx)
[Luther Vandross]
Are you gonna be 
Say that you're gonna be
[Jamie Foxx]
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh...
[Jamie Foxx - Chorus]
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right 
(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)
[Kanye West]
I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring da cool whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home
Man I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action
My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
I'm a play this Vandross 
You gon' take your pants off
Imma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get right
[Chorus X2]
[Twista]
Got you lookin at the gliss at my hands and wrists
While i'm layin back smokin on my canibus
When it come to rockin the rythm like Marvin and Luther 
I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be
Sippin Hennessy
Play some R&B
Tryina smoke a B
Lookin properly
Feelin on a G?
And always (Well Well Well Well Well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm
Smokin on a B
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B
And I got to leave
Something to the 23's?
And I do it (well well well well well)
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl 
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me
[chorus X2]
[Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
'cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
'cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin' 
Tryina make you moan
And I do it (well well well well well)
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
kittens come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what kittens tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
You got to
[Chorus]
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
All day long man, we back in town
[Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy
Street poetry is how ya boy get paid
And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say
[Kanye West]
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
And where the glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams
See I showed you on the champions how we get down
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown
You got B2K on all your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats
[Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight
But y'all kittenz don't shine so you couldn't relate
[Chorus]
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
[Consequence]
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy
[Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
and the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when kittenz leave the city and switch up they reps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat
[Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks
[Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show 
'Cause that's the best way to get a kitten with dough 
Then fake a pregnancy, then call the attorney-a 
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture 
[Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L.B
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice
'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice
[Chorus]
So relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Calm down)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (It's the R.O.C.!)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uhh)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yeah)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Uh-huh, yeah)
All day long man, we back in town
[Repeat 'til end]
Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down
I'm up in the woods

To slow down time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my line
I'm building a still
Down the time ooh

I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Your my devil, your my angel
Your my heaven, your my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, your my jail
You're my lies, your my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
Your my questions, your my proof
Your my stress your masseuse
Mama say mama say mama gos-an
Lost in this plastic light
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in that afterlife
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid yea
I'm up in the woods
(Run from the lights, run from the night
Run for your life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line

I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
[Chorus]
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line
[Chorus]
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
All of the lights
All of the lights
All of the lights

Aaaaaalright it's on
I grew up thinking I was wrong
And always said if they let me in the b-tch

But if I am it's just in time
Because I got the extra nation so you f-cking understand it man

On a scale of one to ten, what you rate yourself
Here's some champagne, hydrate yourself
I know I'm lookin' good, you lookin' great yourself
I mean you shittin' on these bitches, you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My, my, my, whips is side by side
He just talkin', mine's outside
Do you mind if I, take you on a test, do you have all-wheel drive?
And if that baby purr, I'm gonna baby her
Bitches gon' hate and maybe worse
'Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work, I know you was on pur-pur
But this is a whole new arena
See, kittens come by talkin' bout they make it rain
I'll make that bitch Katrina
Mr. Kanye Omari, with my entourage, no Ari
And a motorcycle jacket, no Harley
She said dude, that's cool, gnarly

Twista where you at? Abracadabra, did he vanish?
Hurry up and come out but I ain't want to panic
I say that I'm in the zone but they don't understand it
Physically I'm here but mentally I'm on another planet
And it only kinda made 'em look at me like I was stupider
Now they askin' which planet, is it Jupiter?
So I let the money show 'cause I know stacks could talk
I'm mackin' on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on a chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian, I'm kickin' pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what I put together in the dungeon
I'm lookin' for a UK chick with a nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And I can't believe they let an American werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with a tonic
Steady be trippin' while smokin' on the hydroponic
When I spit it like this they be callin' me bionic
Kanye with the Twist, kitten, how ironic
And I'm astonished haters don't wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain, 23s be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on gone
Alright alright, alright

I'm blowin' on flame but yours is all white
And I'ma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night
Phony ass people, I don't feel they demeanor
So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of rap's heroes, who came from zero
Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas
Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb
I am the shit: It don't make me numb
Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal 'cause I spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm or any tibble [unverifiable] I can do
See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
I follow through because, uh
Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright
Alright alright, alright

It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)
I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never
Ever be solved
And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'
Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
I'm amazin'
Yeah I'm all that
If i ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?
Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive for victory
Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!
I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon
That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms
They like oh god!
why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' [Repeat: x3]

(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)

So now, you here with me, social gratitude, leave the attitude way back at home 
Yeah, you see 'em look, baby, let 'em look, give you cold looks cuz we look cold 
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth, don't worry about what we can't control 
All the talk in the world, loss in the world 'till you finally let that thing gooo 
You wanna check-in to the heartbreak hotel but sorry we're closed 
Baby, don't worry 'bout it

[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibe
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other kitten buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kitten that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel
[Chorus](x2)
We ball til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise
[Chorus]
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)
[Intro:]
kittenz is gossipin' across the city,
They don't know why Gin & 'em ain't comin' to get me
So I hit the block and do about sixty,
And I put my glocks' to 'dem like blaow, blaow, blaow
[Verse 1:]
I'm fin to get on this TV and put shit down,
I ain't fin to let these light skin kittenz come back in style
I'm fin to turn this class clown shit to crazy-D
They told my mamma I was bipolar
Kanye to the year, you heard the name
Tracks plus racks, finna murder the game
Uh, can I get it?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
All these is believe and breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only different story, fuck that up
Iceberg flows, I gotta pose
Every whip but the studio
In the hospital dissin, flow is very sick
Plus very rich, very thick chain
Very thick til I got every bitch
20’s at the bottom carry the 6
If I cock back and shot on my band with precision
You can’t hate this, with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
But she taste this, rather taste this
Taste my aiming, watch me H this
You whack rap, catch me a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
We stand to my tims, grab my laces
Got loofs on, the only type noose on em
Define how like triple goose in it
What the fuck I gotta do? Another truth in?
See it don’t really matter what yall brooling
Yall ain’t satisfied til we shoot you
So if somebody gotta die tell me who want it
That Chi Town, Southside booth, we on it, we on it
What in the fuck was that Kanye
I told you to do some shit for the kids
You can give me your motherfucking graduation ticket right now
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A motherfucker can't pull you across that stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trying to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a kitten
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mother hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Mother what you gone do now
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me but don't anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody
Oh, it can't be G.O.O.D music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B
But you kittenz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami
GLC gon' be stoned as Angie
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family
It's the Cons fool, word
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys
No different than Grand Prix's
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my kitten Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is
The Grammy Family
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
Let's do it
Kanye West, c'mon turn me up
And Black Thought, c'mon turn me up
And Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up
And Talib Kweli in the house with
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?

And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
Yo, I hit these Rmcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of ifs and ands, it's just straight talkin'
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin' off more than you can chew, create offense
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin' nails into they own coffins
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket launchin'
Black Thought, quit playin' him close and back up off him
Kweli, spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
The real Emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D, my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin' me
A black and blue emcees, actin' new to me, get smacked stupidly
That lack skills, like the black community lack unity
Still my rhymes heard like Ali De Phrase
Step off the stage to shouts of Kweli boomayyay
See these four Emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
kitten you, gotta, understand the plot ta
Movin' and groovin' and always improvin' a lot ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche ya Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra
Slash Chi Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
Okay, my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan kitten competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin' Pharoahe for help
From natives walkin' in trailor tears to players sippin' Belvedere
We always comin' well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin' fear
Plus, even my kittenz from the Bede say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well aware
Your style under developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
kitten you fugazi, sayin' ya crew blazin'
Like sayin' Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin'
Guerrilla monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed spittin' contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed, cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat, kitten
That's what I'm talkin' about, that's what I'm talkin' about
C'mon, that's what I'm talkin' about, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
C'mon, that's what I'm talkin' about, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
[Incomprehensible] Kanye West, Kweli
Black Thought, Monch Pharoahe
I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
Another one, leprechaun
Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn
Fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life
I'm living mine
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, sof-sof-softer sof-softer
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, softer than clay
Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, peeking through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan

[Intro: woman (Kanye West)]
(first of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(you got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(what else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil'
Kim (yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
Cuz I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"
[Hook: Kanye West]
Cuz I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on "Chyna Doll", I woulda did them beats for free
Cuz only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D Dot was just teasin' me
I bought somw earrings like Baby that may be fake
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can hit 'em or Nas with Lazy K
And lady may, maybe hey
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a kitten that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her
[Hook: Kanye West]
I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh Trina?
Oh I'm be right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to-
I ain't feelin' that verse
I think I just fell in love with a porn star 
Turn the camera on, she a born star 
Turn the corners in a foreign car 
Call the coroners do the C.P.R. 
She gave that old kitten an ulcer 
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh) 
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh) 
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh) 
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh) 
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what) 
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh) 
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah) 
[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind 
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line 
No more drugs for me 
Pussy and religion is all I need 
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life 
Never in your wildest dreams 
Never in your wildest dreams 
In your wildest 
You can hear the loudest screams 
Comin' from inside the screen 
You a wild bitch 
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy 
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy 
Or do anal, or do a gang bang 
It's kinda crazy, it's opposite the same thing 
Well I guess a lot of kittens do gang bang 
And if you run trains, we all in the same game 
Run away slaves all on a chain gang 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
[Chorus]
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star 
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard 
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids 
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over 
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day 
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day 
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change 
That's a dress of her back and told her get away 
How can they say they live they life wrong 
When you never fuck wit' the lights on 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
Have you lost your mind 
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line 
No more drugs for me 
Pussy and religion is all I need 
Grand my hand 
Baby we'll live a hell of a life 
I think I fell in love with a porn star 
And got married in the bathroom 
Honeymoon on the dance floor 
And got divorced by the end of the night 
That's one hell of a life
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass
Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before"
Stop that
What, you want some patron?
I got that
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol
You put a kitten to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass
See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all
Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some cris and some mo
And we about to let it flow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it blow
Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!
[John Legend - Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
[Kanye West]
I'm in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
If you work with my people, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower (Lara) Stone's walls
Jessica Gomes, yall, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosia, Anja Rubik, 
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee, too I'm a freak boo
I'm wylin I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen.
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I'm tryna eat out so what we going for dinner for
[Pusha T]
Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Tryna hide what's obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon coloured suits from the VMA's
Oh you was watching, who the f-ck wasn't
Me skip across that stage in 5 dozen
Yeah 60 grand for a minutes time
Italian vogue styled a kitten for a minute rhyme
Lets be clear and lets be fair
The best things in music's being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffins near
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Ryan Leslie]
It's time for a lesson in model behaviour
Damn, look at all the bad b-tches I gave you
Man I can see the flaws to your flavour
Look like wonder woman and still need a saviour
Maybe it's a billionaire maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur holding titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me.
[Lloyd Banks]
He ain't Kraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm
Fly clothes and Lear shows, type kind of stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I'm puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone
Must've been the liquor talkin', I'm beggin' the cups, "C'mon"
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler's poem
My sound's full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh)
kitten, make some money 'fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I'm back like a nine milli, runnin' New York City
See me clearly through the storm
The world's mine, sits pretty in my palm
Sean Don (Chandon?) as we continue on
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Kid Cudi]
kittens think they know I'm the guy with the story
They don't really know what's in my head, f-ckin' with me
How can I be better?
I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I'm off the nini
To the people who don't know Cud', know what?
Rose gold presidential on my boney wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, had her LC the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don't really matter, we escaping with our paper
"Hey ya", I'm on my Andre 3000
I'm all good now, a kitten don't need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when let me not reflect on the old sh-t
I'm on to the new act, on to my new script
B-tches better have they thoughts before approaching
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other kittens
Do things all before living, haters, copy, I'm the image
Haters, copy, I'm the image
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s Dee-ricious”
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeer's, just horses and a Panamera Porcshe
We on two fifth shopping, what the damage cost
I got your fam' while you bidding in the can up north
Woops, I’m at Niemens I hope they still got em
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast cause Christ is born
We gon’ party all night til the lights come on
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Yeah, mom and dad I won't be home for the holidays
I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York I’m still reppin' for the A
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
On the stoop of that Brownstone shoveling the brownstone
Santa’s on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it’s Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like it's down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?
Oh, pause for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment
Where’s your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up!
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Lenox Ave to Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just kittens selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
That's where the snow’s at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo’s
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood
All of the flashin’ lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought 
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out 
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about 
And they still want to know when the album comin? out 
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids 
What they definition of Classic is 
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth 
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters 
Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders 
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas 
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches 
Nas, made you look, before the haters 
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus 
This is classic 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[Kanye West:]
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
It?s performin?, look how long the line is 
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless 
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened to my pace 
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I expected it 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[Nas:] 
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this 
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice 
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time 
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man 
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you could afford it the car ain?t important 
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment 
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[KRS One:] 
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded 
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect 
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop 
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC?s 
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and rap 
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they people 
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from, but if you got money, fuck it, cause I want some
B.I.G. fuckin' with me, oh god, whoa
OK ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique

Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see (Ain't nobody fucking with my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique)
Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique

They want the, they want the
Yeah, I'm talking 'Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih'

Yeah I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we
Me turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me, now who with me? 
¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation, I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade

Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the
Break records at Louie, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the Un-American idols
What kittens did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talking to God for so long and if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my mothafuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the
Kanye West! (Swag King Cole) DJ Khaled!
Can't a young kitten get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
Can't a young kitten get money any more? (ah)
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor (ah)
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only kitten I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass kittens got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'
Can't a young kitten get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without, don't talk to me 'bout style, kitten, 
I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you
Hollering 'bout some hoes, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you

Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot sex
And Hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feelin' myself too much, I guess

In small towns that I don't even know

And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get ‘em a clone
He said, yeah, you know, you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here, is a heat rocks

Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton
Before I mark the plane make sure, you cop them trees to spark up
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You lookin' good in that one showin' off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis?

Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it. 
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it) 
No, we have no money 
We are sharin' jeans. 
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on. 
How many cars do we own? (None!) 
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!) 
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car? 
Yes, we will. 
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!

Buncha kittens 
Broke, broke, broke, broke, broke!
This was founded years ago 
By broke slaves, years ago 
Who did not have, years ago 
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago 
Who did not have when we could not eat 
Hmm, remember that? 
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm? 
Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
Remember that?
[Quietly]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)

Broke, broke broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi- 
Leader: I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us.
There is an imposter among us.
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has.
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!
Kanye:(stammering) I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-
Leader: No, you speak up, brother!
Kanye: I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-
Leader: What?
Kanye: I wanna stick to my roots, and-
Leader: What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.
Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like that, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.
What's next?
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
That are not A&R's in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
No Electro, no metro, a little retro, I perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo, Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out though is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sisters
They momma, named them after white bitches
No next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the Jewerly's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like "Is he gon' be dope again?"
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?
This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood 
When I was back in my pajama shit
Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat 
Will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop
Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips
Pink champel, Valentine L
Bally's on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like "where the Madonna's now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said "you raised that boy too fast, 
But you was raising a warrior"
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
[Chorus]
Just gots me a crib and a new car too
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe
C'mon let's get married babe
C'mon let's get married
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house
A lil white fence, just like this, babe
C'mon let's get married babe
Let's get married
[Jagged Edge]
Meet me at the alter
In your white dress (your white dress)
You won't ever need another man
You never, ever want from another thing, no
I've been feeling you
I must confess (must confess)
Ain't no gonna break this thang up
I ain't going nowhere, no
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)
[Chorus]
[Jagged Edge]
Said you want some karats
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)
Is it good enough for you to brag on
When you show your friends (show your friends)
I just want to be with you
Girl there ain't I think I won't do
Want you to be the one to say I do
We can start a family
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
With my tuxedo
He asked me do you take this
Woman to hold and keep the safest
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics
Diamonds your bestfriend
That makes sense because
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts
But as long as you gots your defenses up
You can never get the love that was meant for ya
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna
club
Real thugs don't never fall in love
Always on the g-o, for the d-o
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie
Since my money get right theses days
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades
I gots the church, the ring
There's something I'm forgetting
Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the wedding
[Chorus]
He's straight out of a neighborhood where kittenz hate
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a kitten 'scape
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...
[Pharrell]
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The muthaf-cking skateboard P
Knowing that your mee lo
Playing games like you're cee-lo
In a tight situation like speedo's
You can have it your way like Carlito
My kitten will be happy to give you torpedos
And have you car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot a-s kittens that like to front
I'm on some BBC bape sh-t
I'm on some cake sh-t
In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it
My flow interupts your homeostasis
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street sh-t it sound like sweet sh-t
Straight liquorice you kittens sound ticklish
80k large for the Hermes dream
Coke n crop in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine
Dion, me and my kittens like frion
You b-tches on my pecan b-tch
She got an a-s you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it til I could seat on
Try to get her freak on
Ask me to R Kelly ya and get pee'd on
I said it aint me maam
That 8 behind me still got the burner
Yes the enzo is stilll black like Sojourner
Truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth
Spittin' what I did in the booth
I'm out, pooof! 
[Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era
Waanna bear n tell the truth, I dare ya
Ya lie, so eat these whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers
For terror made in america too live
F-ck the property or give me my props properly
High off life this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep going
Where my city at, I'm like steak and fries but never die
They wanna Ghostface wanna be me
But they will post haste follow me into the after life
That means you going right after I've
But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow
So some way some how I have survived 
Who is he that we see coming over the tides
In a speed boat, boat load of pride
Full of rum, dress shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rappping and fashion collide
So OMG is the "C" from the C-R-S LOL'ing at you haters 
[Kanye West]
Yes, MR West turn that new child rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus we through with a tyrannosaurus
Tyrone it's been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone
We'll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine
There's hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, business manager's Jewish
And if I get sued my lawyers Jews
Some girls do, grab the cojones
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us
Brand new ferrari's I gotta make the donuts
C-R-S is like a hip hop Chris's bonus
kittens is hating on the internet I couldn't tell
I was too busy rapping GOOD as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail! 
Tell collect to get the new sh-t that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinche, gettin' Benji's, get half off Fendi
Half of that's to Cindy's
Hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me
Props in New York but Chi town's the city
Get my city hoochie's Gucci, Monica Bellucci's
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendi's?
I'm so ultra I'm even over Oprah
But let me check your account, haha no sir
Don't stop, don't stop...
Let me see you put your middle fingers up, to the world, 
I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time (fingers up)
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up, middle fingers up!
(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up
'Cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way, 
Let's take it a notch up, take it up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up! To the world
I made up in my mind
Doin' things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me see you one more time (fingers up)
To the world, to the world, to the world
Mm' ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs like, "These kittens tryna hold me back
These kittens tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only kitten in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you, holy crap
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something

This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's balling but yea that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo ass for a white girl
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head
But it's too late, it's too late
He gone
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way
Too late, we gone, we strivin' home
Gone, we ride on chrome
It's too late
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Are-are-are-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone
We strivin home, gone
I ride on chrome
We strivin' home, gone
Killa, I ride on chrome
Knock knock, who's there
Killa Cam, Killa who
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin' to the dealer
No concealin', no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, kittens still doin' puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all kittens want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just goin' tell 'em (Too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (Gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you want to see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin' like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin' my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin' alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now
We strivin' home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that
Cause
I been pourin' out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented "Gone With the Wind," cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a kitten talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone
I'm
Ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me want to get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin' it all behind
Kanye step away from the limelight, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin' over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18 year old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirror
How we out in Europe, spendin' Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin' the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone
Like we always do at this time

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life
Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good
Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now,

Well maybe yall do or maybe yall don't
But I don't really care (yeah)
Cus how we on it all the time (uh)
So imma get my money lets go
(Kanye - Verse 1)
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolaty
"what's up wooo" that's old news
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Ha?
I swear my whole collection so cruise
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods
That kitten crazy I told you
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else)
If you fall on the concrete that's your asphalt
If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo
When you getting money cuts don't matter cus a kitten past go
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole
Right next to lucifer, tell him I said hello
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him I said hell no.
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh?
(Beyonce)
My kittens is home, I guess I got everything
Everything I want, but I don't
Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before
No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud
Doing things not allowed
And I swear it's going down right now
I know one thing my momma would be proud
And you see me looking up
Cus I know she's looking down right now
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now, 
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now

Poor the champagne let your watch show
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a fossil
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie
Somebody needs to put us on camera
The world of rollies and everyones family
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical
This the cris year, last year was magic 32
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye'
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask julie she heard in may
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate
FIrst of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between fergie and jeez
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored
All my hommies GD's but I am lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life to crazy to think logicaly
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy
My life is like a childs solutions become reality
(Beyonce)
Now go get my throne cus I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone and imma make it hot
Till it's time to go when it's time to go
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now, 
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My kittenz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me "don't touch me"
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
kittenz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my kittenz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said "I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said "Ye' you don't love me"
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly
Provide a new coffin
You don't seek murder like this this often
God level

Might as well make a new casket

See the rollers roll up wit ribbons
I see the we poe, we sold then we driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin'
It's plain to see, kitten's can't fuck wit me
'Cuz I'ma be that kitten fo life, this is not an image
This is got given, this is hard liven
Mixed wit crystall sippin', it's the most consistent
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
I know you'll neva let me down
Get up I get

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now kittens can't make it to battles to chose leadership
But we can make it to jacobs to [unverified] the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just dun b feelin' it
Racism still alive they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D. to get up in to sam's club
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
That why I've baptized at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where kitten's pray, you con's are getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get [unverified]
Notin' sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I'd like to thank you for they way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye
'Cuz look what a accident did to left eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watchin' me from the other side
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
I know you'll neva let me down

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find
Yeah I always find
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know

Twenty four seven, three sixty five, 
Pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, 
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your best move, 
You could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
Split and go where? 
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty bitches in the baller-kitten matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know where I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake sleep isn't new
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
i pray you will
Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time she might leave soon
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will
Wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will
[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
'cause I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed 'cause of the whips and cream
'cause when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal kitten when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on it's way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"
[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the word "go"
Couldn't watch another kitten get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word
[Kanye West]
'cause she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me
[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Oh, you didn't think we can do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from po pimping to poppin' tags
From Chunkiest to Slow Jamz, oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, O-four range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl but you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my, my, my, my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at one O six and park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me, you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice, like Kobe right

I could make you a celebrity overnight
You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights, when you take the bath
You got, such a sensational ass
I'ma get you Jimmy Cho and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her, a two thousand and three
Make her smile, when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CD's, and DVD's
Take you to Bebe's and B.C.B.G.'s
I can get you in the places, to be into
The people to know or show you things, sticker than to
I wanna be your lover, undercover don
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can rich your blood
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see you in some Gucci or Roberto Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em, hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club, we go
You was born to be a po', how you gon sticking fo' do's
And I love you, 'cause you freaky with the dope clothes
Drop it to the flo', let it go when you roll slow
And I love it, when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me, and have a brother going, oh, oh
Girl I love, how you roll me right
I can make you, a celebrity overnight
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like

You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down
I just gotta ask you, what you need
What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star
Are you messing with the right one?
I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager
Come here girl, I could see you bored
Took you to the queen, that I see you for
Take you shopping on sprees, in stores
I'ma get you, to the MTV awards
We about, to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places, I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Come here girl, you could hang if you bored
We could do, plenty things plus more
I'm about to have you, change in the stores
I can even get you, to the Soul Train awards
We about, to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right
Take you places, I know you like
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night, like she on patrol
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it
Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When did you become a robocop
No, I don't need a robocop
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh oh
[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When you become a robocop
Somebody please make it stop
Stop, drop, roll, pop
Bitch, I'm cold,
Ain't use to being, told stop
So I can never be your Robot
Fast or slow
You can stay, you can go
Now that you know, now that you know
Yea I had her before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know
Soldiers don't ask me no more
[Chorus]
Okay
Okay
Okay (hey hey)
On lonely nights I start to fade 
(On lonely nights I start to fade) 
Her love is a thousand miles away 
(Her love is a thousand miles away) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
It's 4am and I can't sleep 
(It's 4am and I can't sleep) 
Her love is all that I can see 
(Her love is all that I can see) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Winter, winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
If spring can take the snow away 
(If spring can take the snow away) 
Can it melt away all of our mistakes 
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again 
Never again
I love it though
I love it though
Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a kitten did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us
May the God's be with us
And that magic hour
I seen good Christians 
Make brash decisions
Oh she do it, 
What happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up
She casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wantedt, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
(Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a kitten did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down its the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phoney
Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, kitten shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real kitten, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps
[Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it
Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a kitten hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a kitten even wave at her, it's frightnin' but
[Chorus: Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it
[Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass
One for it, one for out the grave
kittens want they reparations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)
[Chorus]
[Q-Tip]
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold booya cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her best friends man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everyday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"
[Chorus]
[Common]
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And kittens wit' things ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinking big like Lil Wayne in the problem set
[Chorus]
[Rhymefest]
C'mon, Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and P's now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
[Chorus]
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater kittens marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack kittens need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Y'all don't from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
Why you come here
I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found
See I'm often at your cross ways
Forgetting it was that Heaven let ya
They'd tried to bring me down
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd tried to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what'd I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed them
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Then say something where you gon end up apolog'in
Let me know if it's a problem then
A'ight man, holla then
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash, let that man get past
You don't need to stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes
Cause how he move in a room full of No's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Ya'll homies lookin' like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?

You Sore Losers Picked The Wrong Guy To Take The Fall
I Probably Trade In The Fall What They Made In The Fall
Went From A Never Quite Was To An Overnight Was
Cause The Way I Flip Metaphor Nobody Quite Does
By The Time I Leave The Club I'm Wearing A Public Arms
Cause He Must Have Been A Pro The Way See The Pros And Cons
They Callin This The Army 
Money Boys Are We Say Jay B Hopping Down When I'm Trying Do My Laundry

And everybody say, say
I know you, I know you
I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
I'm a raw flow 'cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man, dawg, trust me
Bust somebody head, TLC, where was we?
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
kittens out in Georgetown, and Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, south
Side of the broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort, the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts
Back in '94 they call me Chi-Town's Nas
Now them kittens know I'm one of Chi-Town's gods
We even yo, you still talking no cops
A conscious kitten with mac like Steven Jobs
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside side of the Chi
Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open, I think I know why
I'm back from the future, seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes
People asking him, "Do you have any gray poupon?"
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside, side of the Chi
You in the building but the building's falling
You wouldn't be balling if your name is Spalding
My mind get flooded, I think about New Orleans
Back in school, y'all kittens, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling
If rap was Harlem, I'd be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G Rap, we're calling
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
With kittens masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait 'til they say, "Yeah, he ran up at the Oscars"
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans don't love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, holla
We some true Chi-Town legends, accept no [Incomprehensible]
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
The un-American Idol, Tower like the Eiffel
'Lean Wit it, Rock Wit It', black like the Disciples
Know when to use a Bible and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Things' like Spike do
Through conflicts is crucial and trauma is psycho
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
We're coming from the
[Incomprehensible] spice it up
You might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up, take your life and
Yo, we're coming from the
We're coming from the
Now beat that
And your mothers saying "go to college"
So you finish college and its wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and crazing
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey now you'll get that  25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money
No more borrowing money from mom for my high
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level
Which is being a secretary's secretary!
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary 
Who never went to college
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart man
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, 
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"
I say "no, I don't know what it is, 
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".
I'm cold 
I'm cold 
I'm cold 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is farewell
I got my life and its my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know (that you know)
Tell every one that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)
Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well know you know,
Tell everybody everybody that you know!
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is farewell
Baby girl I'm finished!
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repentin'
And now we just resentin'
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high I be gettin'
And its all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stink,
But you are Mrs. p-u
And I don't see you with me no more

And that's one thing that you know
That you know
Stadium status
Uh
My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin
Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib
Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother
My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends
Don't kill this shit
Yeah uhh
They no I wanna shine they turn my light's off
They no I love to rhyme they turn my mic off
What can a do to get this dirt off my shoulder
Man these haters be hatin
They don wanna see me
Happy, happy, happy, 
They don wanna see me
Happy, happy, happy
They just wanna see me
Down, down, down
They just wanna see me
Down, down, down
Yeahh
What can I do about about it
Not an damn thing
I'm tired of everybody sayin I can't sing
Well look at me now I'm singing freely for you haters
What are you gonna do with 2-0-9
You still gonna be hating on young rock
Man what you hate it for
They wanna see me fold
I'm about to loose control
Hookx3
Yeah
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
Ohhh
Yo yo
I'm makin dough now
Of course the hating go round
Plus the flow is colder then sarah palins home town
If I wasn't me I'd prob be moody too
You don't like me and rock
What we do to you
Did we crash and party
Take your girl, steal your gig
Or all of the above
Well then Ifeel ya kid
Bein me is like a gift an a curse
Because even though I'm the best
They wish me the worst
They be judging on my records
Without listenin first
But my song go for their?
She aint skippin a verse
Nahh
I can accomplish all my goals
Even if I'm blind folded
If you don't wanna see me happy keep
Your eyes closed
Hookx3
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
Ohhh
Yeah...
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you, but I need you, 
I love you and I hate you at the very same time 
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad 
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said 
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says 
God talk to me now this is an emergency 
And she claim she only with me for the currency, 
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery 
And I was to proud to admit that it was hurtin me 
I'd never do that to you at least purposely 
We breakin up again we makin up again 
But we don't love no more 
I guess we fuckin then 
Have you ever felt like you wanted to kill her 
And you mixed them emotions with tequilla 
And you mixed that with a little bad advice 
On one of them bad nights 
You have a bad fight 
And you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit 
And she sayin muhfucka yo mama's a bitch 
You know domestic drama and shit 
All the attitude 
Ill never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you 
But im a be the bigger man 
Big pimpin like jigga man 
Oh i figure it's 
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you, but I need you, 
I love you and I hate you at the very same time 
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad 
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said 
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says 
God talk to me now this is an emergency 
And my kitten says I shouldn't let her worry me 
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently 
But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it 
This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now 
This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me 
And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny 
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually 
Cause every time that I try you will question me 
Say "you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me? 
You don't see how your lies are affecting me? 
You don't see how our life was supposed to be? 
And I never let a kitten get that close to me! 
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be! 
You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be!" 
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me! 
I fucked up and I know it G 
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique, any street
If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress
Father is the black Bruce Wayne, only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains
Tryna hand feed us tell the kittens to anty up
We not off no more, pearlies in a show, fur
So pick your auntie up, I gotta run to that pole
Artist: Kanye West
Album:  College Dropout Unreleased
Song:   DreamKillers
[Chorus 1]
They gossipin, it runs the city, they don't know who watchin them 
When they comin to get me, so I hit the block and bend
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like blaow blaow blaow
[Verse 1]
Im finna to get on this TV and put shit down
I aint finna let these lights skinned kittenz come back in style
Im finna turn to this class clown, shit to crazy g's
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D.
I told em, w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners
Old folks said he‘d never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold
That get green on ya, when you get green on em
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em
Somebody told success is the best revenge
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support
 
[Chorus 2]
They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Who know a dream, uh they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
[Verse 2]
Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'cause we the leaders, and they the followers
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit dog, and they the flies
How you gon tell me how to live my life
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right
They are the misery that loves company
'cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said “Oh you graduated?” No I decided I was finished
Chasin yall dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up
Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya
Come around wit ya but they aint down wit ya
They the dreamkillers
[Verse 3]
And I'm through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow
They be like “That's cool, you got some beats for me tho”
Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a FUCK what you got to say
Anyway what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even takin wages in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon be like “Peace”
This kitten came from the Chi, moved to the east
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York, what you aint never took a tour there?
What you aint know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dreamkillers
 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 1]
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I’ve been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These kittens ain't doin' shit
Them kittens ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You kittens ain't breathing you gasping
These kittens ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
God, God, God, God!
God, God, God, God!
Who's fault
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure
As a last resort, and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about 2 A.M. and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you 
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other, kitten's is stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Rubbing my name threw the mud
Who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a kitten like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
You probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing
Whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to the nother motherfuckin' level!
Now a neighborhood kitten 
Like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, Goddamn! Who thought you how to get sexy for a kitten?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you, motheruckin' butt ass naked, with them, Jimmy Choos on
Who thought you how to put some Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy thought me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now shit!
You done went all porno on a kitten OK
And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy thought me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I never fucked before
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
Who the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that kitten I'ma thank him
I'ma buy his album
I'ma download that motherfucker I'ma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this kitten
Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
You went to bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source
I remember! Twista had this on in The Source
That's right, that's right! 
Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a kitten like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well
[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey 
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
[Kanye:]
My homey Mali used to stay one 29th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day 
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin
Al B Sure kitten with the hair all wavy
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy 
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car 
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
And there was a lot of flirting involved 
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow...
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey
[Paul Wall:]
What It do 
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunnk open screens on neons lit with tha 5th relaxin
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park 
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on a switch sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawlin like a caterlippar 
I'm tippin on those 4's I'm jamming on this screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do?
[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey 
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today 'cause tomorrow man you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
[Kanye:]
My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live 
[GLC:]
And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident 
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on Volks
My cylinder quiet like tip toes 
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow
Chopped and Screwed 
Yeah..
Drive slow homey 
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Drive slow homey

Whooooooooooo, what up derrty?
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo
[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..
[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'
[Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails
[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..
[Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just lik

Woo! Cause you a milf and I'm a motherfucker

Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' strippers to a super C.E.O
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as hell with all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good (OH!) when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin' [?] very weary
Yup! On the 35th of Neverwary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I pregnated your mouth, girl, ooooh
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
Fuckin' all over the house, girl, we just messed up a brand new couch, girl
You ain't on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck that
[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you
[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Verse 3: Beyonce]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washrags, he wear it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body Benz serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good-good
[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Verse 4: Jay Z]
Hold up, that D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
Now eat the cake, Anna Mae said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we going in, we be all night
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Bridge]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Chorus: x2]
Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh
Shorty gettin' it in with me, yeah
She said I brought some friends for me but i don't know why 
'Cause they ain't gettin in with me, uh-uh
[Jadakiss]
Yo, you know me I'm with the ghetto diva, stelleto fever
jello shots, yellow reefur
Same rules apply, I'm back on top,
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop.
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of patrone, gettin' top on Yachts.
The medallions are mountin' rock on rock
The whole world want to know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't get brains I told her, let me get knowledge yourself
I told be proud of yourself and dig deep,
and try and see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back 
The ferarri truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn if I call back, what
[Chorus: x2]
[Kanye West]
I'm with this bad ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm kitten*ian that's straight up kitten*
Now is it just me or do them ugs have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try an treat me like I ain't famous.
My apologies are you into Astrology 'cause, um, I'm tryin' to make it to Uranus 
See that's a little Don Juan game,
all across your chest like Sean Jean name
kitten*s tryin' to figure out, since Kan' came
who's the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype.
Ain't no tellin' they go'n' love you after tonight.
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles f*** models
spend money til your broke, my kitten* live your life
Ahhaahhhhhh!
[Chorus: x2]
[Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me, 600 Benz with me 
she want to spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club 
'Cause I got my mens with me
She said she leavin' her friends for me, they ain't gettin in with her 
'Cause she goin' bend for me
her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me, 
look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me using her mouth for me, 
she lookin' out for me, 
She said 'Kiss where you live, I said you see the bridge, 
when you step on the balcony
Let's go
[Chorus: x2]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and 
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my kittens get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a kitten ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, kittens cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest kitten, I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said, 
"I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, 
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
kitten hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
It was all good just a week ago
kittens feel they selves 
And then Watch The Throne drop
kittens kill they selves
What kittens gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
kittens tellin' me "You back" (you back)
Like a kitten ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way kitten, you should fuckin' quit, kitten
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam kitten
Goin' HAM kitten, me and Jigga
And a kitten still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a kitten glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
kittens fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi kitten
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with kittens
kittens ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
kittens took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots kitten fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God 'cause you know a kitten just went Ham
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM

[Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself, they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my kittens about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute
[GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be...
(GLC where you at kitten?)
How many kittens you know put their life on the line and get signed
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' kittens that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' kittens up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks
How many kittens you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and ye
And offers to sell and yell, uh
[Chorus: Kanye West]

[Ludacris]
How you ain't gone FUCK?, bitch I'm me
I'm the GOD DAMN reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest
Ahh!, come on we gone party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Stand up! stand up!
Stand up! stand up!
[Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My kitten Tony been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real rolex it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks Red Hot like Anthony Kiedis
To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hovah get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins
Chorus
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (yeah)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (uh)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! stand up!
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers
Different DNA, they don't understand you
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
There is this transcendental, on another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me 
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
WHOO!

[Jay-Z]
I know my English ain't as modest as you like
But come, get some, you little bums
I take the cake from under the baker's thumbs
I bake the cake, get two of them for one
Then I move the weight like I'm Oprah's son
Uh, I'll show you how to do this son
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry paddings
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
He padded hisself the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker think twice
'Cause the gat that I clutch got a little red light
Need a light?
[Hook]
To smoke that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek always smoking that la-la-la

Excuse me miss, I'm the shit

Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami
[Jay-Z]
We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them
Sick with the pen kitten, no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, kitten you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!
[Hook]
Still smokin that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. baby, sing our lullaby
C'mon!
[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami
[Verse Three: Kanye West]
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential
That have fun breakin her fundamentals
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
and Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam
[Hook]
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby
C'mon!
[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
WHOA, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
It's Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
It's ironic what's happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil, 
I know it's a crappy deal, 
At least it came with a few toys, 
Like a Happy Meal, 
I'm spaced out dog, 
I be on that moontalk, 
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle, 
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib, 
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles, 
I'm so anxious I'm gettin anxiety
Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me, 
They say I've been an asshole, 
I said if you acquire me, 
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I'll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off, 
I'm Paranoid Like bonin' Raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat
I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey
Remember him from blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass versad that they couldn't keep up
Ya see how I creeped up?
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their haircut
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the kitten-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award
Damn, here we go again
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killin's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when kittens is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today
Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer (Woo!) write it in bold letters
They love a kitten's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yughck)
(Matching Daytonas, rose gold on us)
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us (ooh!)

Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams,
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my kittens say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told (I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes (If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes (I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes (Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my kittens say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke kitten racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich kitten racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be kittens now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation

Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie

Y'all kittens can't fuck with me
Y'all kittens can't fuck with Ye
Y'all kittens can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock kittens up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prisons
Get your piece today

Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house

Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up

So long, so long, so long
You cannot survive
And I'm not dying
And I can't lose
I can't lose
No, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again
Too high)
All of the lights (All of the lights)

Turn up the lights in here baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
(All of the lights)
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
Something wrong
I hold my head
M.J. gone, our kitten dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a kitten replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night (All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, Grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please,
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night (All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these kittens know, yeah
Get it right, eh
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these kittens know, yeah
Get it right, eh
You should go and get your own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
And also was about to do that line (Line, line, line)
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time (Time)
We going all the way this time (Time)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say
Artist: Kanye West
Album:  College Dropout Unreleased
Song:   whole life
[Verse 1]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama benz JEEP
We'll put 50 I get this on the first take
But that 50'll break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim
Had a girl nickname sprewell 'cause when I tried to stop
She still made me spend
Back when Avies was in, my dog crazy kid had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again
And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said “This car real old”; I told her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club
And get a girl that's into the fitness
Tryin to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get insiiiide
[Chorus]
Now I been hustling my whole life
Tryin to get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I been polly'n with this one girl that claim “I gotta work tomorrow”
But tonight's the night, so poor another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doin fine
[Verse 2]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Please, what I gotta win 5 Grammy's before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys
If I can't bone, I get a clone, get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She vibin, don't stop her there, told me that she love the Roc so much 
She drove all the way to far Rockaway, for a Rocawear
More populaire, 'cause I abracadabra'd my Nissan
To a car throwin the peace sign, PEACE
Damn that's like the same line I used in the first verse
But w-w-w-wait it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K, before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew's CK
In a CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
Im tryna find a crazy fe-male wit a cutee face
I big pimp her on the the D.L. like UGK
And then I told her
[Chorus]

[Chorus: Twista]
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
'Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought
[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a kitten for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a kitten off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking it's a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
kittenz claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003
(Throw it up if you...)
[Chorus] - 2X
I'm living' in that 21st century 
Doing something mean to it 
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it 
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it 
I guess every superhero need his theme music 
No one man should have all that power 
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours 
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power 
(21st century schizoid man) 
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open 
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling 
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands 
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen 
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin' 
Huh? I see you in the mornin' 
This is way too much, I need a moment 
No one man should have all that power 
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours 
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power 
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours 
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man) 
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast 
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass 
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole 
I'm an asshole? You kittens got jokes 
You short-minded kittens thoughts is Napoleon 
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in 
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic 
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted 
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts 
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault 
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty 
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts 
Reality is catchin' up with me 
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody 
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me 
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece 
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power 
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours 
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder 
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours 
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man) 
Holy, powers, Austin, Powers 
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation 
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation 
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit 
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit 
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick 
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with? 
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin' 
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin' 
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
You got the power to let power go?
(21st century schizoid man)
I was on the Million dollar

POP, POP, POP, mmm goes my Rubba Bands

Your my lies your my truth, 
Your my war your my truce, 
Your my questions your my proof, 
Your stress and your my masseuse, 
Mama say mama say momma Dondas' son, 
Lost in this plastic life, 
Lets break out of this fake ass party and turn this into a classic night, 
If we die in each others arms, 
We'll still get laid in the after-life, 
If we die in each others arms we'll still get laid. 
 
Chain Heavy/Sweat off My Face 
(Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
 
They try to tell me my chain broke the levy, 
Maybe cuz it's flooded, 
Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin, 
My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing, 
My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin', 
While yall got all caps on?, 
Don Cheadle Time, 
Get extra black on em', 
Burn Hollywood burn, 
Take too long for the homies to get their turn, 
Probably be cremated before I get my urn, 
They try to tell that aliens built the pyramids, 
I swear life's a bitch on a period, 
For every instant cuz every hoe thinks you see, 
I made my jeweler add a few mo links, 
You can look at me and tell I don't care what nobody think, 
And my face always lookin' like somebody stink. 
(Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
Here we go, like we should, 
Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
Here we go, like we should, 
Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
Alright okay, feel the sweat on ya face, h 
Ere we go, like we should, like we should, like we should 
What color was the skin that bared the cross, 
No matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off, 
How many caskets will we see in one lifetime?, 
That's why Miles Davis coping is mic time, 
I keep that notebook on my ottoman, 
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800's, 
Yall forget that I got called kitten on Twitter so many times, 
Man I lived that, 
Man I'm just trying to find out where to raise my kids at, 
Cuz they don't want where they crib at, 
Hey real tom lookin' for a nice park, 
Twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark, 
This is the flow that solar eclipses, 
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to, 
In this existence, 
Don't give up now just a little mo persistence, 
I want to thank Ice Cube and Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away huh, something might happen, 
This is the making of a masterpiece, so we broke out the chains and told the master peace.
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
Up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these young brothers from the City of Wind 
Like juice and gin in the city we blend 
Amongst the hustle Titties and skin 50's and rims 
Y'all know the Sprewell's and trucks with detail 
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em 
Felt the southside venom with rawhides and denim 
Bent minds collide with 'em in a system that tries victims 
We livin' it my man in the fast lane pivotin' 
On the block yo they sellin' like Eminem 
On the block get jumped off like him and them 
On the block is hot you can feel it in your skinenen 
Shorties get the game with no instructions supersymbolin' 
Eyes right it seems like the fight is dimmin' 'em 
Come my man kuzzle like I'm kin' to him 
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him 
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
I'm up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
It's all good in the hood like 
Rags and Timbs 
Throwbacks and Timbs 
Blacks and Rims 
Whether on ball courts and tires of all sorts 
We never fall short 
With us, it's all force 
Like And 1's someway some hand guns 
The days the fam one is all over for 
Cash is colder than fobolobo 
But self I go toe to toe 
Wonderin' if it's for the art of for the dough 
Though I know to grow a kitten gotta learn to let go 
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto 
Arrows on tarot cards pointing to the grind 
More livin in more prisons 
Pointing to my mind 
Shine the light up 
Clench my fist tight holdin' the right up 
Freedom fightin dark year for the years to get brighter 
Situations that jaws get tighter 
My man tried to get his way... 
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I had to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
Up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
Hey yo I, I know I could make it right 
If I could just swallow my pride 
But I can't run away 
You put my gun away 
You can't front on me 
I, no I can't let it ride 
No no not tonight 
No I can't run away 
You put my gun away 
You can't front on me
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know

At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her 
But I didnt take nothing (thanks) 
Every bullet came from the same gun 
Just from different angles cause I was pickin strange places to aim from

Youre hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin brains out 
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse

Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make em like this anymore

Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
Specially on my Pastel, on my Bape shit

New Gospel homey - take 6. And take this, haters

If you made plans or not

But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gonna do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And will do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger

Yeah, yeah, it's a brand new day, y'all

Turn me up in the top a little bit, dog
Want you to know, want you to hear this one
(The sun's shinin')
Loud an' clear, bright an' early, listen
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you, mother fuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump an' fake
But dog, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business an' I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin', this is not for you
On my J.O. with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
An' it's been like that since the day, yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck, do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low
(Let the sunshine)
Standin' in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn kitten, I am, Black Dante
(Let the sunshine in)
That kitten, that dude, black people, let's move
(The sun's shinin')
Shout out to my man, Talib Kweli, yes
We on top a, top a, shout a, shout a, check it out
Slim kitten that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim an' more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, 'Hail Mary', full of grace
kittenz come in an' shoot up the place
An' make you pull up your face
The deck, Im'ma pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State
Where it ain't no escape
Two four seven, seven one eight
An' thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle an' stay
To the states, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
Like a long time man of the way
(Let the sun shine)
You understandin' me straight?
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
(Let the sunshine in)
It's what it is, what it is
An' thats what it is, you see? Ha, fire
(The sun's shinin')
'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception an' sharper picture
Revolve around God an' involve with kittenz
These elements above all my scripture
An' make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn, it don't matter if you holler or whisper
You're comin' through clear 'cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya
Yo, brothers an' sisters, fathers an' mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the kittenz
Rebel guerrillas, the ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra ordinary an' plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move on
I move in, an' y'all must move on
(Let the sun shine)
'Cause I move to strong an' I know what my feet move for
Make it go without a brand new car
(Let the sunshine in)
I was fresh without a brand new song
An' give a fuck about what brand you are
(The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles an' standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all
Be good to your families, dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody need family, dog
Raise your hands, you understand me, pa
That's what it is, that's my man
Family an' my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle
Masada Malia, Son Dial la, Magic Mel
(Let the sunshine in)
Life is real
All the real soldiers, black people, we family y'all
(Let the sunshine in)
(The sun's shinin')
Let it be bright
[Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion
Ay yo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus and y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
(?) I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it huh?
My swagga is McJagga
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it
Why he so mad for? why he gotta have it?
Cuz I slave my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa! 
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!
Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon
[Jay-Z]
Gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans
Cuz my knots don't fit
No one on the corner
Gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans
Cuz my knots so thick
U can learn how to dress
Just by
Jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Follow my steps
It's the road to success
Where the kittens think u thorough
And the girls say yes
But I can't teach u my swag
U can pay for school
But u can't buy class
School of hard knocks
I'm a grad
All blue Yankee
Is my graduation cap
HOOOOOOOOVVVVAAA
Dipping different rovas (?)
Wipping with the soda (?)
HOOOOOOOOVVVVAAA
Could u even have any doubt 
after doutbt it was ova.
[Lil' Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch! 
But I'm too clean for these boys
I require what I desire
I got stripes Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in yo shit just me no moss
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these 4 guys
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write yo name on the bullet make u feel special
HA! What the f**k you boys talking about?
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about! 
and im gone.. bye
[T.I.]
You go see weezy for the wordplay, 
Jeezy for the bird play, 
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy, 
All my verses picture perfect
And they meant to serve a purpose, 
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless, 
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous, 
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it, 
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is what another rapper do, 
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities, 
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that, 
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at, 
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary, 
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary, 
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary SWAG!
[Kanye West] + (Ludacris + Shawnna)
Now, blaze that!
(Stand up!) (uh) (stand up!) (yeah)
(Stand up!) (uh) (stand up!) (uh)
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
When I move you move (just like that?)
Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!
(When I move you move) just like that?
(When I move you move) just like that?
(When I move you move) just like that?
(Hell yeah!, hey DJ bring that back!)
[Ludacris]
How you ain't gone FUCK?, bitch I'm me
I'm the GOD DAMN reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest
Ahh!, come on we gone party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Stand up! stand up!
Stand up! stand up!
[Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My kitten Tony been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real rolex it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks Red Hot like Anthony Kiedis
To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hovah get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins
Chorus
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (yeah)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (uh)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! (just like that?)
Stand up! stand up!
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
All them other kittens lame, and you know it now
When a real kitten hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
[Chorus]
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
(That's that crack music kitten)
(That real black music kitten)
How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man
[Chorus]
From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the
Gonna lock us up in a, home
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman
Ta being a president look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you round that
Crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?
That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music
Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my kittens from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my kittens ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
All these things
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights 
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these kittens got me
I hate these kittens more than the Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
(Ad libs)
Yo Hip-Hop Is kittenz still talkin bout I can't rap Come On Now
Look for me Young K

My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z

Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust kitten ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom
That I call my lair
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam!
They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep
Light passin', light fashion, light pappers that pass part a gun
Black hands up ??
Black guns up ??
Dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year
It's another day
It's the same fight
Dip around, sound the bell
Mix it up and ?? where you live it up the beat
And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it
From the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep
From the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
Say in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact with shorter emcee
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [Mos -- kitten]
[Jay-Z]
Just to get by
kitten I sold coke, kitten I pushed lah
Carried a fo'five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fry
Slimmed for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
kitten either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms
Doin five dollars worth to work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin
[Kanye West]
It's on I'm packin weight like nina simone
Piano flow
It's like a Michaelangelo paintin' a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get's you choked up this is the treat anaerobe
This is shy kitten I mista all of that
Fuck a mattress, put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me toughen up
Put some bass in your voice
They used to tell me lighten up
Put some mase in your voice
Lord willin' I ain't kill nobody
But I have a feelin' this album
That I'm gonna make a killin'
Well now that's chillin'
This is love it or hate it music
But, at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry
This is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me or I'm ??? on be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more
We're makin' history
[background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
[background singers repeat in the background]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
[background singers]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by
We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
To set the tide to the violence on the TV during the war
Killin each other is easy, there's war and liquor for fallen kittenz Believe
Me, it's ghetto love, I bet you seen it all befo'
Just to get by, my people we get fly
My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah
kitten come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne
I said to rest in peace to Nina Simone
[Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my kittenz and street motherfuckers
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
(Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma)
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building recession to get by
[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
[background singers repeat in the background]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Some people try
Some people try just to get by
For my piece of the pie
You love to eat and be high
We deceive and we lie
And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo
People ???
Keeper of the skies
Can't see your eyes
See the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs
Yo-yo-yo-yo yo
[repeat]
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hell, a problems
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you feel me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, or to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful but this
Bastard's flow will bash a skull and I will
Cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we assholes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cause we don't want to here that weak shit no mo'
Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
Now now now now now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26, tellin' me that she 36-26,
Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, 
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high
Yeah, I can't believe this kitten use my name for picking up dimes but
Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real kitten yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it
Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
With real kitten quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, kittens in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate kitten
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then
Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
Blazin, mi don't want dem
Mi need dem
Blazin
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hands of God
So y'all better quit playing with God
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper who compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass kittens who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass kittens to bite you
I don't wanna hear what some kittens might do
Old kittens mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody else had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa es su casa
That's our costra nostra
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God
Ain't no way I'm giving up on my god
Fraud kittens, y'all kittens, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
(Woo!) That's rare kitten, (Woo!) Ric Flair kitten
(Woo!) The power's in my hair kitten, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair kitten
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful kittens, I don't like
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like (This Chicago, kitten!) 
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike (Whoa!)
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite (Whoa!)
But I never hit a woman never in my life (Eh!)
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phif' (Eh!)
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice (Whoa!)
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice (Whoa!)
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice (Eh!)
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right? (Eh!)
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes (Whoa!)
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life (Whoa!)
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night (Eh!)
Free Bump J, real kitten for life (Eh!)
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that kitten nice (Whoa!)
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right? (Whoa!)
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like, a snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that kitten that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
We are not one and the same, kitten I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my kittens holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my kittens and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
I done sold purp' (purple) I done sold white (white)
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Artist: Kanye West
Album: Unreleased Studio Tracks
Song: I Need 2 Know
[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know
[Verse 1]
I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn 
That white benz, dyke twins
I aint gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the kitten producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down ‘fo I pay for this room 'cause
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 2]
Now if you got it you got it
And if you don't then you prolly wont
Sissy kittenz call em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em
By em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em
Take em back to confuse em
So she don't know if she coming or going
'cause mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Back to show just frontin and flowin
Jewelry stuntin and glowin, this life is something I know it
And I been known to have a hoe or two
'cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you
After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin and havin sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep em impressed
Let em seat in the Lex, never, eat em unless
That fuckin cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me
[Chorus x2]
[Chorus]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams
Boy you know what it is
Brooklyn
Just put your face in the bag
Bitch I know u ain't over there starin at my boy
Yeah I know u ain't call ur self holla'n at my boy.
Uh huh huh
Just put your face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Put your face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Put your face in the bag
Look at the price tags
Just fuck the price on the tagz
And just put your face in the bag
I heard that in brooklyn
When I am brooklyn
You can ask my baby boy
I treat my baby well
Ain't nothing soso
But I know usher well
We in them benzes black, grey white mercedes sell?
The same thing keri told soulja boy tellem put ur face in the bag
Paper or plastic itz safer to bag it
When them bitches dead I will pay for they casket
Broke bitchez even can buy a gucci bag
As we proceed to give them what we need
Like we bringin down the 'e'
Them kittens say just put your face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Just put ur face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Just put ur face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Just put ur face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Just put ur face in the bag
Uh huh huh
Put ur face in the bag
You
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a kitten cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

2002 aight i sounded real mad on the last mixtape im not even gonna
Go there this time ok
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the "No Smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride
Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life have flown
I'll fly away
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)
That's all them can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing a dat man do
Action thing yo a badman ting
I'm a badman you if know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)

Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like Ah!
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all them can do (say wah, say wah))
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all them can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing a dat man do
That's right I'm in it
(I'll be long gone, grab that ass, set your code)
Say you love who I
Lay it off, it off
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, when
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids and the wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the night life
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, getting head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playing
Uh, they don't see what I'm saying
Uh, they be balling in the D-League
Uh, I be speaking Swaghili

No matter what I do, see I been waitin all my, waitin all my life, yeah,

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, cause this must be heaven
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)
Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these kittens that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop "lion" like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!
Yeah, feels good to be home, baby!
We in the streets player, get your mail
It's only two places you'll end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, sill nowhere to go
Two words, United States, no love, no brakes
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move!
Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit

Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters (Throw your hands up high)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
And keep ya hands up bustless, busters (Till they reach the sky)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
Hey yo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide
Cause I, rep that, till I, fucking die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics
Go get his rhyme like, should of been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, player hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"
Screaming, Jesus save me
You know how the game be
I can't let em change me
Cause on Judgment Day, you gon' blame me
Look God, it's the same me
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (oh)
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (oh)
From the bottom to the top
So only place to go down
And keep ya hands up bustless, busters (Till they reach the sky)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap kittens into two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
My God, two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free young bars, fresh men of the Roc
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
And broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
Have you screaming out four words "Send for the Lord"
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad
Throw (red) Your (white) hands (blue) Up (black)
Throw (calm) Your (down) hands (move) Up (back)
Throw (motherfuckers) your (asking) hands (who is) up (that)

High! (an show it to 'em like)
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real kitten back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more kittens off than Cochran, huh?
On sight, on sight
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncing
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
On sight, on sight
Uh-huh
Right now, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now
I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up
No, I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, antidepressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
Took me out of my car
Now I'm in his garage
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian
My game was timid now my flow much bolder
Got a chubby brown angel sittin on my shoulder, sayin
(Girl singing)
You know, it don't matter what you do
Cuz I'll always be there for you
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Grow a mustache
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Slap your wife's ass
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Never smoke grass
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Really pass gas
Be-Cleve in yourself! Goodnight!
[Intro]
Yo, this that shit
Just to let kittens know
You can’t fuck with us
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
Sit down kitten, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She’s missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It’s kinda I'll though
I’m downtown tryna find Anita
That’s where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man’s not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds, 
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I’m finna be
Holla at you now, know we’ll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I’ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain’t around no haters you can call me later
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game
I know the game
I know the game
Y’all know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game
She must’ve known where the dollars at
Cause it ain’t taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain’t stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I’m questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from kitten? You ain’t from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I’m right here
He mad cause I’m with her and he ain’t with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can’t get er
So when I came out the kitten hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game.
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit motherfucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking
(I'd like to propose a toast)
(I said toast motherfucker)
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
So get your ass up off the wall
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only kittens that help
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big-headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
So get your ass up off the wall
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye
I'm almost Raymond'
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You kittens wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, kitten
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term
African American Express
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all kittenz on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for my kittens
So get your ass up off the wall
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
We outta here baby!
"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konichiwa," bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
kitten please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch
We outta here baby!
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
(Kanye)

Uhh, And holy water odds against Ye
It's slaughter ever since the day I opened up that midnight marauders
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment
From the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace, 
They call us pompus, 
Can I be honest? Honestly, Modesty wasn't ever in my policy, 
Apology accepted, you aint say it? Shoulda said it, 
As soon as I did, all the Bullshit was deaded.

I know us kittens prayin um down fallin weak shit, 
But I'm never goin down here, 
Even on ski trips,

Damn, I bet you just as sweet as you look bitch,

Good music man Ye where he find me at,

That Ima get a compliment on any fuckin continent from
Freaks that's fine is shit without this designer shit, 
Big business, respect my conglomerance, 
Girls get check, but my bank get check more, 
Whenever kittens check up, I'm who they check for, or have a check for, 
Loui V shit so much domnier print fuck around and play checkers, 
And these rappers get critical damages, 
But I rap to good it's no need for bandages,

Cuz I'm first place, 
And second is my crew, 
So move, Bitch.
Baby, It's me... Maybe I bore you
No, No it's my fault cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby Puffy, Jay Z
Could all be better for you
Cause all I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)
Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like 
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are the cause
All I could do was love you
Baby when i used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah)
Oh! I used to (wheeen I used to)
Love you (used to... Love you)

used to love you
You're gonna miss me now... 
(Grazie a *Star* per questo testo)
[Samuel Christian] 
You ready?
[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing
[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks
[Chorus: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not run from an-y-thing
I swear this though
[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time
[Chorus]
[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate 
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...
[Chorus] - repeat until fade
Order, huh
Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)
You know what the Midwest is?
Young and Restless
Where restless kittens might snatch ya necklace
And next these kittens might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these kittens who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so long
So long
(Jesus Walks with me)
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
"I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
and the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
to choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
HOOK: I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
to put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
she gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
in and out I'm movin through her student body union and
she, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
she said, I aint no fool I make it up in summer school
HOOK:
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Heh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin
who said what, why you trippin girl, why's you fussin?
got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
tend to hurries in ten places at once
plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
or caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my buisness
HOOK:
I'm tryin girls out, just tryin girls out
put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
holla at ya when I come off tour
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a P.H.D.--A pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only
2 way or phone me if you tryna bone me
Yo man got moe-nee, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, thats no doubt, this kitten's phony
You a light skinded Nia, a dark skinned Aaliyah
A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
We can ride in my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya
I be goin' in and out just like a robberia
I'm tryna take this money like robbin Gia
Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
and my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
and it get so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free
"I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
when it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
aint gonna say my nose? can't be over
but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently
just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me"
[Intro: ODB (K. West)]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! {*continues until chorus comes in*}
Yo this is Dirt McGirt, I'm chillin' wit Kanye West
He's killin' y'all kittenz on the beats
He's killin' y'all kittenz on the tracks
(Where ya plaques at dog?)
The game is officially over!
Go kill yaself!
[Chorus: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not mothafucka, it's The Roc mothafucka!
[Kanye West]
Keep the Receipt mothafuckas!
Now y'all gon' stop talkin' that shit that you talkin'
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the Hell so gon' afford that coffin?
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the shot since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My kittenz had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove kittenz postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters
Dog, kittenz had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards.. HUMPH!
Now after all that it took
I made it to The Roc, I'm guess I ain't as dumb as you look
[Chorus x2]
[Kanye West]
Now.. I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you kitten's tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rappin' and I can't do nothin' for ya, man
S.G'll hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov', if you ain't Cam'
Damn, I know you say he's killin' hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feelin' hisself
Yup, just 'cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who ya hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
You goin' through movin' critters, now who's laughin'?
The best producer that rap better than the rappers
[Chorus x2 - last line by K. West the 2nd time]
[Ol' Dirty Bastard (K. West)]
Aftermath still makin' them hits, kitten?
Lunatics still makin' them hits, kitten?
So So Def still makin' them hits, kitten?
Bad Boy still makin' them hits, kitten?
Wu-Tang still makin' them hits, kitten?
Ruff Ryders still makin' them hits, kitten?
(Cash Money) still makin' them hits, kitten?
Dirt McGirt still makin' them hits, kitten
Yo yo the game is over, go kill yaself!
Go kill yaself.. kitten!
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more!
Til the casket drops
Third times a charm right?
Ha ha, come on!
I'm kinda like a big deal
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow runnin' on Big's heels
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels!
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou' in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha ha we're ballin, drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-up is the gang and I'm all in!
To the powder and the flame I have fallin'
Get money, blow money is my callin'
Yugch! Watch a kitten burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a kitten be
Spittin' fire on the P-J in my P-J's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like T-J
Y'all ain't peep? I said Marshall's we play
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction!
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I bee hop in the ring, kittens ya cash in
It's like stoppin' a train,
kitten think he's stoppin' my reign
Talk slick while droppin' my name?
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'
The C-4-S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you so
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
[Pusha T]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it muthaf-cker
Yes
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my shine into Moses
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them civil rights sposes
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op this priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
Ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the shower posse
Gone! 
(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it m-therf-cker
[Kanye West]
I'm here, it's the misogyny
Bad bitches massaging me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don't judge me, ugh, for the following
Fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
Take of that Givenchy and let's get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Cruncy
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy it's a sin
But if it falls in your lap it's a blessing
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Had used the main leathers (leathers, leathers, leathers)
[Cyhi The Prynce]
Cyhi, Cyhi, Yeah
Boy, we looking for trouble
Maybe if we wasn't black then we wouldn't have struggled
Player, all I got is trap kittens and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle
Got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
So I'm running through them circles, 
Boy I'm looking like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in 'cause kittens was looking
I've tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog I'm good for a scuffle
Don't be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I've tooken a couple
Feds asking kittens questions but I wouldn't rebuttal
'Cause I'm Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn't play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain't nothing silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I'm eating off of rather yellow gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don't get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like a yellow road
[Big Sean]
GOOD, I do it
B.I.G. Sean Don kitten
(But you found it mutherf-cker)
Bitch
I'm in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherf-cking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you're not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don't need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stack's in my trousers
(Boy)
New double-D's smashed in her blouses
F-ck a hotel, my kitten we rent houses (houses)
My kitten, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I'm just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy
I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, dish it, look like CPR
'Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I'm snapping like yo' ass just finished a poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile, I'm chilling with all these kittens, counting all this money you ain't
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a BIG before the Dime
Greet me wit a middle finger when you see me
It's cool, 'cause I can't see yo' ass from this side of the TV muthaf-cker
[J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is putting fear in all the older ones
Down played me to downgrade me like they don't notice son
Your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in 'em
F-cking hoes while teaching kittens to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph's son
High as f-ck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I'm better than Hov, but I'm the closest one
Heard you looking for trouble, what, I'm supposed to run?
Yo' bitch invited me inside her, ain't I supposed to cum?
Got kittens that'll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of heaven's gate, fronting like you know someone
Talking hard, but y'all still ain't push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain't pussy
F-ck it, everybody can get it
When you're this hot, everybody's a critic
But when you're this high everybody's a midget
All this mean mugging from kittens that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch
And you don't want no problems on some math class sh-t
So check the young genius out
F-ck the World, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real sh-t is what you been fiending 'bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming 'bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout
[End]
[Intro - Swizz Beatz]
This is something special
This is something new
(Repeat)
[Mos Def]
The power of observation
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shade
He knew those lights only grew bright to fame
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell will hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, but what must they give away
Who was uninvited, who was asked to come and stay
Surprise it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time
Hither and gone, the day of days
Yonky yone this tiny stone illuminated by a star far gone
Only a star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small
Furthermore, the end is not the end no stop but a pause
What we can witness is all that is at all
Cuss the mock over scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers see the sleepers
Why would you wake 'em, sweet Jesus and life on Earth
Seek heaven first
Let put in this work
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those are liars
When I met you I heard Jesus bells, strings and a choir
I got lines better than kittens albums, plural
King of the urban make your sh-t sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need an epidural
Them other kittens have you looking like a squirrel
And that's nuts
I only hang around with white boys that like black sluts.
Tell em Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissin' you between
The position you play something for us to listen to
I'm tryin' to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you kittens like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if I'm a douche than put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these kittens looseleaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back
[Swizz Beatz]
AK on the lap like what's that
Click clack
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord 
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Swizz Beatz]
All white Bentley I call that momma
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, what's happenin' I get it crackin'
All black carbon, Ima rich yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP while they thank me
And I'd be mad too if you aint me
Call me Mr Deeds or Mister boss
See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
kittens talking funny that's old money
kittens looking crazy but they acting funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me I'ma a bank hogger
Coming through your hood and I brings trucks
With 25′s on it like what the f-ck
Hundred feet and better why they f-ck you stick
Paparzzi on the water, why the f-ck you stick
My face got the f-ck you pricks
My beats go hard like f-ck you d-cks
Pourin' champagne damn thing
Sit there rockin' suede kitten in the damn rain
Aint a damn thing, money aint a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the God damn thing
Get down to the precious lovers
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Raekwon]
Ayo, open glass on my fingers
I sit back like I'm caged but still cakin'
My kittens is hatin'
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne, only just bigger stones they throw
That why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Where you going, if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine
Non believers, no game
I'm zooted down, rollin' a spliff
Maxin' flamin' like wheels got traction
I'm son he's attracted
Guaranteed to service the real kittens
Or cruisin' in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, puffy polo
That blow house is where I reside
Live amongst fiends, countin' currency, hittin' blunts
Only to hear the door rumble
Grab the four, hope it aint the law
Or maybe some kitten tryna score
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us kitten
Cause I don't really trust kittens
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
[Chorus]
I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my Caeser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all OK man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Lupe Fiasco]
Head to the sky, wings raised in
She's about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But aint no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she'll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
How could you do it
How could you do it
[Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can't it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I'm testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Y" sometimes like a f-cking vowel
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wondering could you do a lil' som
Something beautiful
Something that the kids is goin love when they hear it
Thats goin' make them start jumping up and down and sharing candy an' stuff
Think you could probably do something for the kids for graduation to sing?
Yeah, this joint right here man, is for all my Blue Collar kittenz
In the Midwest goin' through our struggle
We know things could be better, huh
And we just want a little more
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit

Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still

Look, now I ain't goin' for the okey-doke
You owe me dough, you better pay me like you know we broke
This industry be tryin' to strangle kittenz in the choke
You think these rappers rich? These kittenz out here sellin' dope
You think it's crazy sayin', "If I had what he had"
But if you had what he had, kitten you'd be mad
Three kids, see dad broke ass
Waitin' on the royalties with no cash
Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin' to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin', "That's umm, I forgot his name who is he?"
He wanted more, never really thought of the loss
Lookin' for more, everybody playin' the boss to get more
Now he just stuck in the sauce like white kids when they got cut off
Daddy I want more
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still

Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still

Yeah, yeah, yeah
This go out to every man tryin' to achieve and hold his own
Them ladies are nice but you gotta leave them hoes alone
They'll take it and bro, break in your phone, call your boss up
(Where that kitten at?)
Or tell your wife to try to break up your home
Now your baby momma takin' your son, learn from mistakes I done
Yesterday we all naked and fun
I ain't thinkin' of none, break in and cum, soon as you done run
This is real talk, kitten one-on-one
Between me and you, now this mono-a-mono
How you gon' catch mono from a hoe that work at McDonald's
Now you lookin' like the clown like Ronald
That's where Kels fucked up, 'cause young girls he decided to fondle
And I ain't fin' ta let HIV's in my bag
I'll start usin' rubbers again, it ain't that bad
You gotta take care of yourself mayne, don't get grabbed
'Cause if you die, people be like, "Aww, that's too bad"
I want more
No matter how much I get

Even when I talk my shit

Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
Everybody so weak like, like, they afraid to speak
If you see that kitten violate then hit him in his cheek
Tryin' to act like, like, you rappin' the street
You ain't a gangsta, you a bitch with a beat
So it's time to make role call, then expose y'all
Adam and Eve shocked in the garden with no drawers
While kittenz gettin' popped on my block with no laws
I grew up with Disciples that'll smash ya gold off
I never plugged, 'cause I know that when you do that shit
You locked in for life, kitten, yeah, etched in blood
But it's hard to get respect when you less than thug
And you ain't fin' to serve here if you ain't with us
Us meanin' them, them meanin' G.D.
Gangster Disciples, the same ones that killed Cochise
So see, how he, well he, meanin' me
Refused to be another kitten dead in the street
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still

My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm, I-I-I-I'm
I'm Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card?
I turned around and replied why yes,
But I prefer the term African-American Express
(Hook)
La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me
Brains, power and muscle like Dame, Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say, There's something I might play
A beat I might make might make they life change
And save their whole deal, Their wrist is on chill
They house is on hill, You could be Lauren Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now you just prayin
(Hook)
[Common]
You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real kittenz see the light got fat girls eating right
[Outro]
Ha ha we in this bitch

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait

So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me

Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it
We could've been somebody
Instead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happening
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
I ride with my kittens, I'll die for my
To all my second string bitches, tryna get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony, uh, yeah yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'Til death but do your part, uh, unholy matrimony
[Hook: Sample and Kanye West]
Bound to fall in love
 Bound to fall in love
Uh huh honey
All them other kittens lame, and you know it now
When a real kitten hold you down, you supposed to drown
 Bound
 Bound
 [Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we know where home is
And so instead of sendin flowers, we the roses
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
It brings the sunshine, oh
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
I, smile, when Rosey come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosey goes away
Oh Rosey brings the sunshine (say)
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh uh
I won't wait, no
School spirit motherfuckers
[Chorus]
Alpha, step, Omega, step
Kappa, step, Sigma, step
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Oh hecky naw that boy is raw
AKA, step. Delta, step
S G Rho, step, Zeta, step
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Oh hecky naw that boy is raw
[Verse 1]
I'ma get on this TV, momma
I'ma, I'ma break shit down
I'ma make sure these light skinned kittenz
Never ever never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'
No, I decided I was finished
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This kitten graduated at the top of my class
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or'a Shirley
I'm tryin' to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason
[Chorus]
I feel a woo coming on, cause
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause
There it was
I feel some woos coming on, cause
A couple woos coming on, 'cause
There they was
I feel a woo coming on, cause
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause
There it was
A couple woos coming on, cause
A couple woos coming on, 'cause
There they was
[Chorus]
I never liked you kittens
Who knew one day I'd be just like you kittens
Uh uh uh alright you kittens
Uh uh uh alright you kittens
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
He walked in our lives
I was only five
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when there wasn't
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum
We are the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces
The kids of bitter split ups
And baby sitters
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new kitten
You old Old Spice wearing
Short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing
Church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon, 
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"
I don't like you kitten
If I was old enough I would fight you kitten
I wanna run over you in my bike you kitten
Don't go to sleep at night you kitten
And it seems like I wasted time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's moving up than I
When I become my mama's boyfriends
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another kittens child
He don't like his mama's boyfriend
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then
Cause when she here he be quiet
When she leave he be talking again
He be wylin again
Be calm I don't drink the drama
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on
You gon marry my mom look
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms
And I did take little man to church
And took little man to school
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules
Even though I aint raised you
You your mama angel
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you
[Chorus]
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
It's your boy Kanye Cheddar and I'm 'bout to sell (a million)
How much he charge for a track? About (a million)
How many kittens bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many girls did I bone? About (a million)
I freestyle battle kittens for (a million)
Hey yo, y'all kittens don't want it
It's (a million) ways to die in this city
Hear me? (a million) Look, listen
A lot of speculation about the money I've made, me and Just Blaze
How are they fo'real, are them kittens really paid?
Rappers I've met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can he really master depths who check by check
And 'H to the IZZO' only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella should fold and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to ghost producin' for D.Dot on the low?
For the millionth time, askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassin' me
Like you don't care about my son's feelin's
Can I get a minute, you whack [bitch]
I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard 'Takeover', who runnin' this rap shit?
Eww fake tits
Shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take Six
What'chu doin' in L.A. with 50 Cent and Dr. Dre?
Didn't one them kittens have beef with Jay?
We doin' this shit for entertainment
Brings guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber let one up out the chamber
BLAOW! {*laughs*}
I'm gonna sell (a million)
And after that I'ma buy a couple buildin's
My dog He Nice named his son (a million)
[Chorus]
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming over
Cause its never over
[Chorus]
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming over
'Cause its ne-never over
[Chorus: x2]
(You make me smile with my heart)
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um
Let how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends
Remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me I mean just
Uhh not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly
I mean let's see
Just maybe
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)
Maybe, baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it
(You make me smile)

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
All them other kittens lame, and you know it now
When a real kitten hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches, bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch

They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "heat" It Up
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front
I make history E'ry day - I don't need a month
The survey says - by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the Nba when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and...

I'm Like "ma'am - I Don't Agree With That Decision
Nothin' Against Him - But If He Step I Got To Diss Him
I Listen To That Weak Shit - All Of It - I Can't Follow It
[Barf) Excuse Me - I'm "whack"tose Intolerant

Yeah
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
Let's do it
Kanye West, c'mon turn me up
And Black Thought, c'mon turn me up
And Pharoahe Monch, c'mon turn me up
And Talib Kweli in the house with
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?

And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
Yo, I hit these Rmcees with the grip of death like I was a Vulcan
Ain't a lot of ifs and ands, it's just straight talkin'
It's hard to swallow at times, so take portions
Bitin' off more than you can chew, create offense
Emcee species endangered like dolphins
Rappers is spittin' nails into they own coffins
Hear come the Dundee moves rocket launchin'
Black Thought, quit playin' him close and back up off him
Kweli, spruce to the tree, Bruce to the Lee
The real Emcee, that your favorite rapper used to be
One by one I knock 'em out like Schoolly D, my rhymes is eulogy
A flea could move a tree, before ya think ya movin' me
A black and blue emcees, actin' new to me, get smacked stupidly
That lack skills, like the black community lack unity
Still my rhymes heard like Ali De Phrase
Step off the stage to shouts of Kweli boomayyay
See these four Emcees came to get down
Rearrange the rap game, change ya whole sound
kitten you, gotta, understand the plot ta
Movin' and groovin' and always improvin' a lot ta
I'll outfox the, average Porsche ya Boxster talk
Break the bank on some old Frank Sinatra
Slash Chi Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from Geneva, you can get slapped silly
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
Okay, my sound drenches, each of the five senses
And hold the shock value of electrified fences
It's truth or consequences, ride wit us or against us
Is you a dedicated soldier, or you a princess, dog?
I'm in it to win it and not for the wealth
Got a crib with a Grammy and a gat on the shelf
Nan kitten competition, gotta battle myself
And me and Kweli on a mission, gettin' Pharoahe for help
From natives walkin' in trailor tears to players sippin' Belvedere
We always comin' well prepared, and all my dogs' smellin' fear
Plus, even my kittenz from the Bede say you hella scared
Truth or consequences, and all senses be well aware
Your style under developed there, hell if I care
What hardship you claim to see, but I can tell by your stare
kitten you fugazi, sayin' ya crew blazin'
Like sayin' Miss Cleo is a true Jamaican, we makin'
Guerrilla monsoon rap, smell the fumes, get in tune wit it
When I attack your city, y'all gon' think Dr. Doom did it
Spit it like white trash in seed spittin' contests
With a vendetta that sent a betta letter bomb to Congress
I'm pissed, cumulus clouds of ominous
Words of the Thor, the rawness that'll restore ya calmness
Unless, you wanna be leg and armless
That's parapaleg' for those who believe in bomb threats
Guerrilla monsoon rap all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat
We come through and all the shorties like, who dat?
Got the whole crowd like, how ya do dat?
kitten you, get smacked 'til ya blue black
And ya crew, give me dap like true dat, kitten
That's what I'm talkin' about, that's what I'm talkin' about
C'mon, that's what I'm talkin' about, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
C'mon, that's what I'm talkin' about, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
[Incomprehensible] Kanye West, Kweli
Black Thought, Monch Pharoahe

Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, peeking through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca

What in the fuck was that Kanye
I told you to do some shit for the kids
You can give me your motherfucking graduation ticket right now
You will not walk across that stage, you won't slide across that stage
A motherfucker can't pull you across that stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
I'm trying to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a kitten
And I don't mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mother hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Mother what you gone do now
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me but don't anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes I'm just not everybody
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights 
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these kittens got me
I hate these kittens more than the Nazi
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
I know it's been a while
Sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay
A-bay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Lights, lights, lights, lights
[Verse 1]
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibe
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other kitten buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kitten that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel
[Chorus](x2)
We ball til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise
[Verse 2]
Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise
[Chorus]
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)
Martin Lawrence(speaks while choruses are sang):"look here, lemme tell you something, ya know.  I'm tired a arguin im tryna share this wit chu,ok?  I'm tryna giv this to yooou, ya know what im sayin?

1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin 'Alazee' out the liquor isle
She said, 'i hope it's not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, "whooa!"
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson airs
Martin again:
Fuck you.  Fuck yooou.  I on't give a fuck whatchu have.  This little indoor-indoor, outdoor pool, little bowlin alley.  Material buuullshit.  It don't mean shit.  It don't make what's in the muthafuckin heart".

We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind

(I'm gangsta, ugh-ugh)
2nd Verse:
Hol' up, wait a second man
That's that thrift sto info
That's sauce again
Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the gold courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why 
How on the low i push jet-skee's so I 
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat.  Why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
What the problem is?!?!?
Martin again: (audience laughs & applauds) "Why you actin like this? But letchu have some Valashi.  Some nice beautiful shit. (Gangsta) They act like they gon leave yoou.  You can tell em look here, Ya know. I'm tired a arguin".    
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it

Last Verse:
Man boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'
A kitten i was wit chu before the cheese
So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'
I bet that she'd be a:
AR-GU-IN-G, Please
I'm not actin like this cause I'm gettin spins on
WU-KR-in, Cin-ci-nat-ti
You think I get my voice so deep
Like WU-KR-in, cin-ci-nat-ti
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this...
(Chorus)
We can't even sit & talk
Witout chu arguin
Girl you must be outta your mind
You're the one who started it
Frankly sick & tired a your lies

Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket 
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahhh) 
Came in the bank with a tank fired a blank 
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her 
But I didnt take nothing (thanks) 
Every bullet came from the same gun 
Just from different angles cause I was pickin strange places to aim from 
(mad rapper man I bet you 50 bucks you wont jump out the window shady) 
 (ahhhh) pay me 
(madd rapper) 
Psych no way fucked up in the head 
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed (wait wait wait) 
Im a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed 
Or I just might start a fist fight instead 
See as far as the dough go 
I go loco see me pumpin gas at your local sunoco 
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa 
Jump turnstyles then run from po po 
Chorus (2x) 
Life stinks we dont give a fuck son we crazy

My daughters babysitter is about to be deported

Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs (God dammit spike)

Slut dont be nice to me Ive had it with girls 
And Ill still be mad at the world even if it apoligized to me (sorry) 
Youre hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin brains out 
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse 
Spread out on a blood stained couch 
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house 
Im sicker than boy george picturin michael jackson 
In little boys drawers shoppin at toy stores **whistling**

Ill throw a stroller at u with a baby in it 
Go ahead pull the plug think I wont smack you 
I just dropped a fuckin pill mom dont vacuum
Uh, Good morning
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test
You got D's motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Lookin' at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit wear cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters sayin' ya changed
Now ya doin' ya thang
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'
Get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch, is you smokin reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we know where home is
And so instead of sendin flowers, we the roses
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
It brings the sunshine, oh
I, smile, when roses come to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
I, smile, when Rosey come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosey goes away
Oh Rosey brings the sunshine (say)
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh uh
I won't wait, no
School spirit motherfuckers
[Chorus]
Alpha, step, Omega, step
Kappa, step, Sigma, step
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Oh hecky naw that boy is raw
AKA, step. Delta, step
S G Rho, step, Zeta, step
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Oh hecky naw that boy is raw
[Verse 1]
I'ma get on this TV, momma
I'ma, I'ma break shit down
I'ma make sure these light skinned kittenz
Never ever never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'
No, I decided I was finished
Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This kitten graduated at the top of my class
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or'a Shirley
I'm tryin' to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason
[Chorus]
I feel a woo coming on, cause
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause
There it was
I feel some woos coming on, cause
A couple woos coming on, 'cause
There they was
I feel a woo coming on, cause
I feel a woo coming on, 'cause
There it was
A couple woos coming on, cause
A couple woos coming on, 'cause
There they was
Now beat that
And your mothers saying "go to college"
So you finish college and its wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and crazing
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey now you'll get that  25 thou, job a year and  
You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money
No more borrowing money from mom for my high
So now you get you're degree tattooed on your back your so excited about it
If you continue to work at the GAP, after several interviews, Oh my god!
You'll come in at an entry level position and when you do that
If you kiss enough ass, you'll move up to the next level
Which is being a secretary's secretary!
And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary 
Who never went to college
She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart man
All you kids want to talk in the back of the class not me, I listened, ok
I was a hall monitor, This was meant to be, 
You know how many classes I took, extra classes extra classes
No I've never had sex but you know what, my degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks to me says "hey you know what's sexy?"
I say "no, I don't know what it is, 
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse really fast".
Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now, 
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Beyonce - Hook)
I got my suit and tie and I don't know if yall know
Well maybe yall do or maybe yall don't
But I don't really care (yeah)
Cus how we on it all the time (uh)
So imma get my money lets go
(Kanye - Verse 1)
Now imma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this an aristocracy
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolaty
"what's up wooo" that's old news
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Ha?
I swear my whole collection so cruise
I might walk in nobu, with no shoes
He just walked in nobu like it was wholefoods
That kitten crazy I told you
Immatue adult insecure asshole (What else)
If you fall on the concrete that's your asphalt
If you pass on that Kane beat, that's your last thought
Get what you ask for I swear that's your ass thought
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
So you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo
When you getting money cuts don't matter cus a kitten past go
Straight to jail yo, in a hell hole
Right next to lucifer, tell him I said hello
Ask if imma be there soon, and tell him I said hell no.
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh?
(Beyonce)
My kittens is home, I guess I got everything
Everything I want, but I don't
Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before
No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud
Doing things not allowed
And I swear it's going down right now
I know one thing my momma would be proud
And you see me looking up
Cus I know she's looking down right now
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now, 
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
(Kanye - Verse 2)
Poor the champagne let your watch show
Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a fossil
Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on this? is so uncamrie
Somebody needs to put us on camera
The world of rollies and everyones family
Stay jordan fresh suites and ferraris coupes
N shortie watch barneys? we head the barneys?
End up at 'mani giorgi and service from sergio pacini
Lamborghini the chain blow off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hella-fied vertical
This the cris year, last year was magic 32
Lyricaly cant' none of yall murder Ye'
Cus yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask julie she heard in may
I killt the fur last, Paris rasied the murder rate
FIrst of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between fergie and jeez
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Everyone of his majesty's swim partys is pageantrys
Cannon ball of the diving board when I am bored
All my hommies GD's but I am lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life to crazy to think logicaly
Heres somthing that you can use an analogy
My life is like a childs solutions become reality
(Beyonce)
Now go get my throne cus I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone and imma make it hot
Till it's time to go when it's time to go
Where you trying to go? you better act like you can see me know
(Charlie Wilson - Chorus)
I know you see me now right now, 
(I know you see me now right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)
I know you see me now right now (Right now)
I know you see me now right now
(featuring Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, Mos Def & Talib Kweli) 
[Mos Def]
History
Shoutin' it every day y'all (right now)
Everyday (right now)
Right now (good mornin', Vietnam!)
Listen
Brooklyn wins again
It's the Stuy, it's the Bush, dem kittenz again
Ta' Kweli, Mighty Def, and that's 'sta on the guest lock
Kanye, you're the dope man in hip hop, now let's rock
Now roll out kittenz, my hometown kittenz
I get it good in your hood so slow down kittenz
Watch the speed though, man, you better let ease off
A street talk into a collision course with these walls - bam!
They don't move, don't pray, don't lose, don't sleep
Light passin', light fashion, light pappers that pass part a gun
Black hands up ??
Black guns up ??
Dyin' wish is to touch the air
Seekin' heaven that wasn't here
Eyes will not see another year
It's another day
It's the same fight
Dip around, sound the bell
Mix it up and ?? where you live it up the beat
And get risen up you're knocked down get it back and get it up
Get off of queer street and get with us
And get clear where we did it
From the heart, from the people
From the top, from the jeep
From the gut, from the street
From my soul to the mic to the essence
Say in my absence you feel the presence, exactly
I make contact with shorter emcee
Me and mine we don't just get by
We get free and that's ready [Mos -- kitten]
[Jay-Z]
Just to get by
kitten I sold coke, kitten I pushed lah
Carried a fo'five
Claimed I was ready to die
Promised never to cry
Held it all inside
Reality was too much to take so I
Kept my mind fry
Slimmed for most of mine
Soon as I closed my eyes
Then I woke up behind
kitten either I load up these nines
Or blow up with rhymes
Cause this flow of mine is like blow up but lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote stuff to rhyme
Nah, I'm a poster for what happened seein your moms
Doin five dollars worth to work just to get a dime
So pardon my disposition
Why should I listen to a system that never listened to me?
Picture me working McDonald's
I'd rather pull a mac on you
Sorry Ms. Jackson but I'm packin
[Kanye West]
It's on I'm packin weight like nina simone
Piano flow
It's like a Michaelangelo paintin' a portrait of Maya Angelou
And gave it to a sick poet for they antidote
If music get's you choked up this is the treat anaerobe
This is shy kitten I mista all of that
Fuck a mattress, put this bitch on the almanac
Dice what they hittin' for, 'lax what you sittin' on
Tracks who you spittin on, rap till we get it on
And don't let nobody with the power to sign
Ever tell you you ain't got the power to rhyme
They used to tell me toughen up
Put some bass in your voice
They used to tell me lighten up
Put some mase in your voice
Lord willin' I ain't kill nobody
But I have a feelin' this album
That I'm gonna make a killin'
Well now that's chillin'
This is love it or hate it music
But, at least we made it music
And we didn't make it industry
This is gon' be interesting
This'll be the end of me or I'm ??? on be an entity
Kanye, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Kweli
We are not makin' songs no more
We're makin' history
[background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
[background singers repeat in the background]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
[background singers]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by
We keep it gangsta, stay 'fo shizzle', 'fo sheezy'
To set the tide to the violence on the TV during the war
Killin each other is easy, there's war and liquor for fallen kittenz Believe
Me, it's ghetto love, I bet you seen it all befo'
Just to get by, my people we get fly
My people we get high, fillin cigars with the lah
kitten come on, even Jesus was stoned before receivin' the throne
I said to rest in peace to Nina Simone
[Busta Rhymes]
Back in the days we was used to doin the shit
I can't call it all in the streets
We was hustlin fiends that asked for it
I guess I was used to just standin on corners
Waitin for paper bags with bundles of crack
Hopin the week was good so I could get money back
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
When I was stressed I possessed a side of my strength
That made me angry and bleed
With the frustration havin me smokin Newports and weed
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Those be the times when I try to rely
On my kittenz and street motherfuckers
And reach out to wifey and then I place a call on my mother
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
(Hey yo mom pick up the phone, I g- I gotta to talk to you ma)
If you was five percent instead of actin stupid and guessin
You had to go and study your lessons
And know your math in the building recession to get by
[Hook: Talib Kweli + background singers]
This morning I woke up
Feelin brand new, I jumped up
Feelin my highs and my lows
In my soul, and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinkin
But I been thinkin I got my reasons
Just to get (by), just to get (by)
Just to get (by), just to get (get buh buh buh bye bye)
[background singers repeat in the background]
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah dah
Bah dah bah dah, bah dah bah daaah
[Talib Kweli]
Some people try
Some people try just to get by
For my piece of the pie
You love to eat and be high
We deceive and we lie
And we keepin' it fly - yo yo yo yo yo
People ???
Keeper of the skies
Can't see your eyes
See the evil inside
The best people you find
Stronger people in mind
I stay readin' the signs
Yo-yo-yo-yo yo
[repeat]
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh

Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hell, a problems
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you feel me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, or to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashful but this
Bastard's flow will bash a skull and I will
Cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we assholes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cause we don't want to here that weak shit no mo'
Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
Now now now now now who the hell is this

Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, 
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high
Yeah, I can't believe this kitten use my name for picking up dimes but
Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real kitten yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it
Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
With real kitten quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, kittens in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate kitten
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then
Now, thr-thr-throw your motherfucking hands (Get 'em high!)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man (Get 'em high!)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands (Keep 'em high!)
And if ya losing yo' high than smoke again (Keep 'em high!)
[Chorus: x2]
Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh
Shorty gettin' it in with me, yeah
She said I brought some friends for me but i don't know why 
'Cause they ain't gettin in with me, uh-uh
[Jadakiss]
Yo, you know me I'm with the ghetto diva, stelleto fever
jello shots, yellow reefur
Same rules apply, I'm back on top,
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop.
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of patrone, gettin' top on Yachts.
The medallions are mountin' rock on rock
The whole world want to know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't get brains I told her, let me get knowledge yourself
I told be proud of yourself and dig deep,
and try and see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back 
The ferarri truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn if I call back, what
[Chorus: x2]
[Kanye West]
I'm with this bad ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm kitten*ian that's straight up kitten*
Now is it just me or do them ugs have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try an treat me like I ain't famous.
My apologies are you into Astrology 'cause, um, I'm tryin' to make it to Uranus 
See that's a little Don Juan game,
all across your chest like Sean Jean name
kitten*s tryin' to figure out, since Kan' came
who's the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype.
Ain't no tellin' they go'n' love you after tonight.
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles f*** models
spend money til your broke, my kitten* live your life
Ahhaahhhhhh!
[Chorus: x2]
[Jadakiss]
Shorty gettin' it in with me, 600 Benz with me 
she want to spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club 
'Cause I got my mens with me
She said she leavin' her friends for me, they ain't gettin in with her 
'Cause she goin' bend for me
her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me, 
look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me using her mouth for me, 
she lookin' out for me, 
She said 'Kiss where you live, I said you see the bridge, 
when you step on the balcony
Let's go
[Chorus: x2]
[Kanye West]
All of the lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
[Drake]
Aaaaaalright it's on
I grew up thinking I was wrong
And always said if they let me in the b-tch
I'd do some damage
I might be out of mind
But if I am it's just in time
Because I got the extra nation so you f-cking understand it man
I'm already for kitten but I
[Kanye West]
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone...
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit motherfucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
Cause they don't fucking
(I'd like to propose a toast)
(I said toast motherfucker)
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
So get your ass up off the wall
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudolph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only kittens that help
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big-headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
So get your ass up off the wall
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye
I'm almost Raymond'
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You kittens wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, kitten
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term
African American Express
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all kittenz on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
And I am
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol, for my kittens
So get your ass up off the wall
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
Stop all your blood clot cryin, I was flyin'
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even pre-requits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all depends, oh, oh
Stop your cryin baby
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
So turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah
[Kanye West]Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc, 
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan... 
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them, 
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line, 
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Drake]But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I
Say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, 
Females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Lupe Fiasco]guess who's on third?
Lupe still like Lupin the Third.
Hear life here till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterwerf
But, before you say another word, 
I'm back on the block like I'm layin on the street.
I'm trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra, 
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarde, Touché Lupe cool as the Unthawed, 
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star, 
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
[Kanye West]They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
Now ain't - that about a bitch
That Imma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't - because you love what I make
[Chorus]
Just gots me a crib and a new car too
I got the ring, but I gotta have you babe
C'mon let's get married babe
C'mon let's get married
Let's have some kids with a dog with a house
A lil white fence, just like this, babe
C'mon let's get married babe
Let's get married
[Jagged Edge]
Meet me at the alter
In your white dress (your white dress)
You won't ever need another man
You never, ever want from another thing, no
I've been feeling you
I must confess (must confess)
Ain't no gonna break this thang up
I ain't going nowhere, no
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)
[Chorus]
[Jagged Edge]
Said you want some karats
Babe, how bout ten (how bout ten)
Is it good enough for you to brag on
When you show your friends (show your friends)
I just want to be with you
Girl there ain't I think I won't do
Want you to be the one to say I do
We can start a family
Cuz when I think about you and think about me
Plain to see that we might as well do it (do it)
[Chorus]
[Kanye West]
With my tuxedo
He asked me do you take this
Woman to hold and keep the safest
Plus to lace her, floss wit paper
Crib and a car, man you know tha basics
Diamonds your bestfriend
That makes sense because
Your a princess and you deserve the princess cuts
But as long as you gots your defenses up
You can never get the love that was meant for ya
Shouldn't you know that I use to come through wanna
club
Real thugs don't never fall in love
Always on the g-o, for the d-o
Man I had to take t-o, smits some cutie
Since my money get right theses days
I wanna give you more ice than the ice capades
I gots the church, the ring
There's something I'm forgetting
Oh, we gotta have J.E. sing at the wedding
[Chorus]
He's straight out of a neighborhood where kittenz hate
They see you, go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomaches ache while he's loungin' in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand when a kitten 'scape
House's with a bigger gate, houndin' him's a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'll rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
'Til he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz 'til where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest player that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G-Unit Records, ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them...
Yeah uhh
They no I wanna shine they turn my light's off
They no I love to rhyme they turn my mic off
What can a do to get this dirt off my shoulder
Man these haters be hatin
They don wanna see me
Happy, happy, happy, 
They don wanna see me
Happy, happy, happy
They just wanna see me
Down, down, down
They just wanna see me
Down, down, down
Yeahh
What can I do about about it
Not an damn thing
I'm tired of everybody sayin I can't sing
Well look at me now I'm singing freely for you haters
What are you gonna do with 2-0-9
You still gonna be hating on young rock
Man what you hate it for
They wanna see me fold
I'm about to loose control
Hookx3
Yeah
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
Ohhh
Yo yo
I'm makin dough now
Of course the hating go round
Plus the flow is colder then sarah palins home town
If I wasn't me I'd prob be moody too
You don't like me and rock
What we do to you
Did we crash and party
Take your girl, steal your gig
Or all of the above
Well then Ifeel ya kid
Bein me is like a gift an a curse
Because even though I'm the best
They wish me the worst
They be judging on my records
Without listenin first
But my song go for their?
She aint skippin a verse
Nahh
I can accomplish all my goals
Even if I'm blind folded
If you don't wanna see me happy keep
Your eyes closed
Hookx3
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna do
Ohhh
Yeah...
I'm living' in that 21st century 
Doing something mean to it 
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it 
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it 
I guess every superhero need his theme music 
No one man should have all that power 
The clock's ticking', I just count the hours 
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power 
(21st century schizoid man) 
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open 
We ain't got nothing' to lose, ma' fucka', we rolling 
Huh? Ma'fucka', we rolling'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands 
In this white man's world, we the ones chosen 
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin' 
Huh? I see you in the mornin' 
This is way too much, I need a moment 
No one man should have all that power 
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours 
Stop trippin' I'm trippin' off the power 
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours 
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man) 
Fuck S-N-L and the whole cast 
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass 
More specifically, they can kiss my ass-hole 
I'm an asshole? You kittens got jokes 
You short-minded kittens thoughts is Napoleon 
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goldies in 
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic 
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted 
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts 
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault 
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty 
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts 
Reality is catchin' up with me 
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody 
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me 
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece 
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power 
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours 
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder 
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours 
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say
And then they say (hey) and then they say (21st century schizoid man) 
Holy, powers, Austin, Powers 
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation 
They say "How was the abomination of Obama's nation?"
Well that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation 
At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit 
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit 
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick 
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with? 
How 'Ye doin? I'm survivin' 
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin' 
I got the power, make yo' life so exciting (so exciting)
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
Now this would be a beautiful death 
Jumping out the window 
Letting everything go 
Letting everything go 
You got the power to let power go?
(21st century schizoid man)
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Shake it up, up rock ya body
Make it knock, knock when you partyin'
Take a break, break in the audience
Do ya footwork break and stop again?
I'm lookin' sharp
You can't compete with the champ
Steady flickin'
I'm holdin' done that layaway rack
Aye, rhinestones all in they face
Gold charms and paper chase
Talk smack from around the way
Gotta put these chickenheads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid, babes
I ain't trippin', I juke all day
I ain't slippin' 'cause either way
When I hit the block all the people say
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Aye yo this mothafucka jammin', I'm on it, it's a anthem
Who is that in the Phantom? Please no cameras
They gone have me on concrete loot in my pajamas
To hide the goods, I would need pants big as Hammer's
I be tippin' them dancers, they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough but now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick on that '84 shit
Oh shit, did you see the way she got her toes did?
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Fast forward to the end of my song
And say third verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit the block I see
Tricks try to rehearse me, hearse me
From manicure sets to silky weaves
They be so grimy, nasty, bogus
Turkey, germy, dirty
Uh oh, Shol' did, you ain't slick, no
Let the pioneer blast my shit
Wait a minute, hold up, kitten
Bubble letters on my butt say fresh
Oops, I'ma go, nails like whoa
Acrylic base, top all gold
Clothes on my back to the paint on my toes
Stay fresh 'cause I'm accustomed to gold
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Got, got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin'
Toes, toes done up with her fingernails matchin'

Kanye:
This song's for all the posers tryin' ta make out that they all bad an' shit

Ya see, I'm just a regula kitten an I'm keepin' it real (Hey, Hey)
Mario:
I ain't no gangsta an' I ain't no thug
The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan
Kanye: T's like dese cat's dat I see all be tryin ta front

When I see a cop crusin' I don't take off on a run
Feel that bulge in my pocket, that's me, girl, tain't no shotgun
Mario:

The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan
Kanye:
My teeth ain't gold, dey a natural white

An I ain't droppin' me money like it's made outa piss
I don't bathe in champagne, man, that's ludacriz!
If ya come to da club, in the center you'll find me
Gettin' down with girls, not bodyguards, around me
Kulcha Don:
Dese foos wanna play dat dey sumptin dey not
Dey tink dey rep'd be bettah if dey sinned n' got caught
But I tink dey brains fried 'cause a life on de run
Can't compare wid bein crazy krunk n' out havin fun
If you hear your door-a knockin do you think it's de cops
Do you hide in your basement till dat bangin stops?
Well my door's always open and de party is on
So forget all dem posers, bring your girls an come on
Kanye:
So if ya see me on de street, girl, just come up an' say 'hi'

Can you love a real boy? I ain't got no disguise
All I got is de love that ya see in dese eyes
Mario:

The F.B.I. ain't tryin'a lock me up
But if you keepin' it real, girl, I could be yo man
Got a heart fulla lovin' an a natural tan
Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought 
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out 
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about 
And they still want to know when the album comin? out 
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids 
What they definition of Classic is 
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth 
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth 
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters 
Everybody co-signing even non-believers 
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders 
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers 
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas 
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches 
Nas, made you look, before the haters 
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus 
This is classic 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[Kanye West:]
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness 
It?s performin?, look how long the line is 
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless 
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers 
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is? 
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish 
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base 
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened to my pace 
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I expected it 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[Nas:] 
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this 
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice 
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time 
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man 
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans 
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you could afford it the car ain?t important 
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment 
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on 
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong 
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to 
classic, better than I'v ever been
Talent, 
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and better than I ever been 
Classic
Better than I'v ever been
[KRS One:] 
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded 
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect 
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop 
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station? 
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC?s 
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and rap 
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they people 
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One
(Kanye West) 
Hello, can I speak to, uh 
Uh, yeah, you know who you are 
You have no idea what you're dealin' with 
Somethin' on some of this realest shit 
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth 
Somethin', somethin', yeah 
That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
I paid for them titties, get your own 
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne 
She say I care more about them "Basquiones" 
Basquiats, she learnin' a new word, it's yacht 
Blew the world up soon as I hit the club wit' her 
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love wit' her" 
Seen by actors, ballplayers, and drug dealers 
And some lesbians that never loved kittens 
Twisted love story, true romance 
Mary Magdalene, from a pole dance 
I'm a freak, huh? Rockstar life 
The second girl wit' us? That's our wife 
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle 
Who's the new old perm just tryn' play second fiddle? 
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle 
But my dick worth money, I put moanie in the middle 
Where she at, in the middle 
(Elly Jackson) 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high (High, high, high) 
(Silly little vixen, mixes 'til mornin') 
(Not swervin', ohh, yeah) 
(Swore you never strolled on a bottle of that potion) 
(Stop motion, ooh, yeah) 
(Jay-Z) 
Go harder than a kitten for a kitten, go figure 
Told me "Keep my own money" if we ever did split up 
How could somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures? 
With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers 
Uh, Picasso was alive, he woulda made her 
That's right, kitten, Mona Lisa can't fade her 
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice 
But why all the pretty icons always all white? 
Back to my Beyonces 
You deserve three stacks for the Andre 
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in mo-seums 
You belong in binges, clothes, rushin' the whole building 
You belong with kittens who used to be known for dope-dealin' 
You too dope for any of those civilians 
Now, shoo, Trigger, stop lookin' at 'er tense 
Getcha own dog, ya heard? That's my bitch 
I been waitin' for a long, long time 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
And live my life, and live my life 
Just to get off and throw my hands up high 
(Silly little vixen, mixes 'til modern) 
(Not swervin', ohh, yeah) 
(Swore you never strolled on a bottle of that potion) 
(Stop motion, ooh, yeah) 
You have no idea what you're dealin' with 
Somethin' on some of this realest shit 
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth 
Somethin', somethin', yeah 
That's my bitch 
That's my bitch 
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch 
That's my bitch
[Chorus]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams
[Bernie Mac]
I knew I was gonna see ya, I knew I was gonna see you again!
I was gonna see you again
Where your god damn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil' book bag
Nobody want to see that
God damn fourth grader
Sit yo' ass down
Now he want to play it again like he got something else to do
You ain't got nothin' else to do
You ain't doing nothing wit yo life
Nothing with your life
What do you think this is?
You better look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
You think this is easy don't you?
You think this is promised
Oh ain't nothin promised with you
Look at my face, do I got a promise face?
Does it look like promise you anything?
Kanye!
kitten! Is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West! Mr. West
[Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it
Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
She let a kitten hit it, and now she only date white men
And if a kitten even wave at her, it's frightnin' but
[Chorus: Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it
[Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass
One for it, one for out the grave
kittens want they reparations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)
[Chorus]
[Q-Tip]
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold booya cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her best friends man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everyday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"
[Chorus]
[Common]
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And kittens wit' things ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinking big like Lil Wayne in the problem set
[Chorus]
[Rhymefest]
C'mon, Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs and P's now?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
[Chorus]
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
Up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these young brothers from the City of Wind 
Like juice and gin in the city we blend 
Amongst the hustle Titties and skin 50's and rims 
Y'all know the Sprewell's and trucks with detail 
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em 
Felt the southside venom with rawhides and denim 
Bent minds collide with 'em in a system that tries victims 
We livin' it my man in the fast lane pivotin' 
On the block yo they sellin' like Eminem 
On the block get jumped off like him and them 
On the block is hot you can feel it in your skinenen 
Shorties get the game with no instructions supersymbolin' 
Eyes right it seems like the fight is dimmin' 'em 
Come my man kuzzle like I'm kin' to him 
He tryin' to stay straight, the streets is bendin' him 
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
I'm up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
It's all good in the hood like 
Rags and Timbs 
Throwbacks and Timbs 
Blacks and Rims 
Whether on ball courts and tires of all sorts 
We never fall short 
With us, it's all force 
Like And 1's someway some hand guns 
The days the fam one is all over for 
Cash is colder than fobolobo 
But self I go toe to toe 
Wonderin' if it's for the art of for the dough 
Though I know to grow a kitten gotta learn to let go 
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto 
Arrows on tarot cards pointing to the grind 
More livin in more prisons 
Pointing to my mind 
Shine the light up 
Clench my fist tight holdin' the right up 
Freedom fightin dark year for the years to get brighter 
Situations that jaws get tighter 
My man tried to get his way... 
I walked in the crib 
Got two kids 
And my baby mamma late 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
And so I had to did what I had to did 
Cuz I had the kid 
Duh oh duh oh duh oh 
Up all night, gettin' my money right 
until the blue and white's 
Po po po po po po 
Now the money comin' slow 
But at least a kitten know slow motion better then 
No No No 
Hey yo I, I know I could make it right 
If I could just swallow my pride 
But I can't run away 
You put my gun away 
You can't front on me 
I, no I can't let it ride 
No no not tonight 
No I can't run away 
You put my gun away 
You can't front on me
Yeah, this joint right here man, is for all my Blue Collar kittenz
In the Midwest goin' through our struggle
We know things could be better, huh
And we just want a little more
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
Look, now I ain't goin' for the okey-doke
You owe me dough, you better pay me like you know we broke
This industry be tryin' to strangle kittenz in the choke
You think these rappers rich? These kittenz out here sellin' dope
You think it's crazy sayin', "If I had what he had"
But if you had what he had, kitten you'd be mad
Three kids, see dad broke ass
Waitin' on the royalties with no cash
Nice car, no gas, stuck at the pump
Had a lil' hot single now he's stuck in a slump
At the top of his section eight, straight waitin' to jump
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Sayin', "That's umm, I forgot his name who is he?"
He wanted more, never really thought of the loss
Lookin' for more, everybody playin' the boss to get more
Now he just stuck in the sauce like white kids when they got cut off
Daddy I want more
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This go out to every man tryin' to achieve and hold his own
Them ladies are nice but you gotta leave them hoes alone
They'll take it and bro, break in your phone, call your boss up
(Where that kitten at?)
Or tell your wife to try to break up your home
Now your baby momma takin' your son, learn from mistakes I done
Yesterday we all naked and fun
I ain't thinkin' of none, break in and cum, soon as you done run
This is real talk, kitten one-on-one
Between me and you, now this mono-a-mono
How you gon' catch mono from a hoe that work at McDonald's
Now you lookin' like the clown like Ronald
That's where Kels fucked up, 'cause young girls he decided to fondle
And I ain't fin' ta let HIV's in my bag
I'll start usin' rubbers again, it ain't that bad
You gotta take care of yourself mayne, don't get grabbed
'Cause if you die, people be like, "Aww, that's too bad"
I want more
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
Everybody so weak like, like, they afraid to speak
If you see that kitten violate then hit him in his cheek
Tryin' to act like, like, you rappin' the street
You ain't a gangsta, you a bitch with a beat
So it's time to make role call, then expose y'all
Adam and Eve shocked in the garden with no drawers
While kittenz gettin' popped on my block with no laws
I grew up with Disciples that'll smash ya gold off
I never plugged, 'cause I know that when you do that shit
You locked in for life, kitten, yeah, etched in blood
But it's hard to get respect when you less than thug
And you ain't fin' to serve here if you ain't with us
Us meanin' them, them meanin' G.D.
Gangster Disciples, the same ones that killed Cochise
So see, how he, well he, meanin' me
Refused to be another kitten dead in the street
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
No matter how much I get
(I want more)
Even when I talk my shit
(I want more)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this but still
(I want more)
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat
I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
I'll never be picture-perfect Beyonce'
Be light as Albi or black as Chauncey
Remember him from blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass versad that they couldn't keep up
Ya see how I creeped up?
Ya see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in a winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
People talkin' so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their haircut
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the N-double-A-C-P award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the kitten-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-a-lot a-cheese award
Damn, here we go again
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killin's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when kittens is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want time, so I can't afford to pay
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
My 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today
Damn, here we go again
Everybody sayin' what's not for him
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan 
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am
WHOO!

Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden (u-uh)
He padded hisself the rap J.F.K., you wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis
Then, hop ya ass out that S-class
Lay back in that Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask

We got brothers full of Arm'i, mami's in Manolo
Bags by Chanel, all Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov' because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a ten, chances you're with him
If you're a five, you know you ridin' with them
Sick with the pen kitten, no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like reign man - twitchin'
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, kitten you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!
[Hook]
Still smokin that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five

Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
Hold up, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight mami
[Verse Three: Kanye West]
She playin she hate when I'm name droppin
So when I talk rap, she gon' change topics
But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
Hov' tellin ya mind brother, I'ma play shy brother
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'ma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential
That have fun breakin her fundamentals
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
and Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam
[Hook]
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la

[Chorus]
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
(That's that crack music kitten)
(That real black music kitten)
How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man
[Chorus]
From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the
Gonna lock us up in a, home
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman
Ta being a president look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music you make when you round that
Crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
God-how could you let this happen, happen, happen, happen, happen, happen?
That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
That's that crack music kitten
That real black music kitten
That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music
Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one is far to mean
The wattered down, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They it sound all wack and corny
Yes its awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well gather round children 
Zip it listen!
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher?
So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized about this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
D.J's need to listen to the model's
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, kitten?)
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town kitten with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon and Louis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respawn the students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
At the mall there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with heroines
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
(And the fires did declare us)
(But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
(And moved her back in Paris)
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

On a scale of one to ten, what you rate yourself
Here's some champagne, hydrate yourself
I know I'm lookin' good, you lookin' great yourself
I mean you shittin' on these bitches, you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My, my, my, whips is side by side
He just talkin', mine's outside
Do you mind if I, take you on a test, do you have all-wheel drive?
And if that baby purr, I'm gonna baby her
Bitches gon' hate and maybe worse
'Cause your ice so brrr I copped you a baby fur
Just to work, I know you was on pur-pur
But this is a whole new arena
See, kittens come by talkin' bout they make it rain
I'll make that bitch Katrina
Mr. Kanye Omari, with my entourage, no Ari
And a motorcycle jacket, no Harley
She said dude, that's cool, gnarly

Twista where you at? Abracadabra, did he vanish?
Hurry up and come out but I ain't want to panic
I say that I'm in the zone but they don't understand it
Physically I'm here but mentally I'm on another planet
And it only kinda made 'em look at me like I was stupider
Now they askin' which planet, is it Jupiter?
So I let the money show 'cause I know stacks could talk
I'm mackin' on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on a chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian, I'm kickin' pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what I put together in the dungeon
I'm lookin' for a UK chick with a nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And I can't believe they let an American werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with a tonic
Steady be trippin' while smokin' on the hydroponic
When I spit it like this they be callin' me bionic
Kanye with the Twist, kitten, how ironic
And I'm astonished haters don't wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain, 23s be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on gone

I'm blowin' on flame but yours is all white
And I'ma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin' on some Louis and partyin' all night
Phony ass people, I don't feel they demeanor
So I hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of rap's heroes, who came from zero
Makin' something out of nothing, call me Gilbert Arenas
Now I'm fuckin' with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back 'til my face be numb
I am the shit: It don't make me numb
Rockin' wit a swagger like I got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal 'cause I spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm or any tibble [unverifiable] I can do
See through a prism when I conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
I follow through because, uh

She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things

Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
That devious is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round

[Intro]
Yo, this that shit
Just to let kittens know
You can’t fuck with us
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
Sit down kitten, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She’s missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It’s kinda I'll though
I’m downtown tryna find Anita
That’s where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man’s not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds, 
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I’m finna be
Holla at you now, know we’ll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I’ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain’t around no haters you can call me later
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game
I know the game
I know the game
Y’all know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game
She must’ve known where the dollars at
Cause it ain’t taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain’t stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I’m questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from kitten? You ain’t from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I’m right here
He mad cause I’m with her and he ain’t with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can’t get er
So when I came out the kitten hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing
[Hook]
But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game.
[Intro - Swizz Beatz]
This is something special
This is something new
(Repeat)
[Mos Def]
The power of observation
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shade
He knew those lights only grew bright to fame
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell will hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, but what must they give away
Who was uninvited, who was asked to come and stay
Surprise it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time
Hither and gone, the day of days
Yonky yone this tiny stone illuminated by a star far gone
Only a star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small
Furthermore, the end is not the end no stop but a pause
What we can witness is all that is at all
Cuss the mock over scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers see the sleepers
Why would you wake 'em, sweet Jesus and life on Earth
Seek heaven first
Let put in this work
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those are liars
When I met you I heard Jesus bells, strings and a choir
I got lines better than kittens albums, plural
King of the urban make your sh-t sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need an epidural
Them other kittens have you looking like a squirrel
And that's nuts
I only hang around with white boys that like black sluts.
Tell em Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissin' you between
The position you play something for us to listen to
I'm tryin' to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you kittens like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if I'm a douche than put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these kittens looseleaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back
[Swizz Beatz]
AK on the lap like what's that
Click clack
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord 
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Swizz Beatz]
All white Bentley I call that momma
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, what's happenin' I get it crackin'
All black carbon, Ima rich yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP while they thank me
And I'd be mad too if you aint me
Call me Mr Deeds or Mister boss
See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
kittens talking funny that's old money
kittens looking crazy but they acting funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me I'ma a bank hogger
Coming through your hood and I brings trucks
With 25′s on it like what the f-ck
Hundred feet and better why they f-ck you stick
Paparzzi on the water, why the f-ck you stick
My face got the f-ck you pricks
My beats go hard like f-ck you d-cks
Pourin' champagne damn thing
Sit there rockin' suede kitten in the damn rain
Aint a damn thing, money aint a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the God damn thing
Get down to the precious lovers
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord

(This is something special)
(This is something new)
[Raekwon]
Ayo, open glass on my fingers
I sit back like I'm caged but still cakin'
My kittens is hatin'
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne, only just bigger stones they throw
That why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Where you going, if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine
Non believers, no game
I'm zooted down, rollin' a spliff
Maxin' flamin' like wheels got traction
I'm son he's attracted
Guaranteed to service the real kittens
Or cruisin' in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, puffy polo
That blow house is where I reside
Live amongst fiends, countin' currency, hittin' blunts
Only to hear the door rumble
Grab the four, hope it aint the law
Or maybe some kitten tryna score
[Charlie Wilson - Chorus]
Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord Lord
Lord... Lord
(Repeat)
(This is something special)
(This is something new)
I can hold my liquor
What this man can’t handle is me
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my kittens
And my kittens they can't control me
You say you know me, my kitten
But you really just know the old me
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on you sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my kittens
And my kittens they can't control me
You say you know me, my kitten
But you really just know the old me
I heard you need a new fad
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home
(Ohh Ohh ohh 
Oohhh Oohhh Oohhh
Hold on if you don't mind
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
Woa Woa Woa)
Open your ears 
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years

I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
kittens come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what kittens tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo, what up derrty?
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo
[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..
[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'
[Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Tory, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails
[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..
[Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just lik
(feat. Ludacris)
[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a kitten act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out kittens like "Peace out!"
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First kitten with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all
[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a kitten act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out kittens like "Peace out!"
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater kittens marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say "Yo, no hablo inglés"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack kittens need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Y'all don't from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
Why you come here
I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found
See I'm often at your cross ways
Forgetting it was that Heaven let ya
They'd tried to bring me down
I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
Always knew that one day, they'd tried to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what'd I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, More Louis V.
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed them
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Then say something where you gon end up apolog'in
Let me know if it's a problem then
A'ight man, holla then
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash, let that man get past
You don't need to stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off fumes
Cause how he move in a room full of No's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear prada, Adam, Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Ya'll homies lookin' like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing right?

Let me see you put your middle fingers up, to the world, 
I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time (fingers up)
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up, middle fingers up!
(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up
'Cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way, 
Let's take it a notch up, take it up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up! To the world
I made up in my mind
Doin' things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me see you one more time (fingers up)
To the world, to the world, to the world
Mm' ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs like, "These kittens tryna hold me back
These kittens tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only kitten in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you, holy crap
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, cause this must be heaven
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)
Now let's take them high (Top of the world baby)
(Top top of the world)
La la la (Top of the world baby)
(On top of the world)
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick had the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man - these kittens that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop "lion" like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I'm, I'm sky high!
Yeah, feels good to be home, baby!
We in the streets player, get your mail
It's only two places you'll end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go, sill nowhere to go
Two words, United States, no love, no brakes
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody move!
Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody move!
Two words, BK , NY, Bed-Stuy
Two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Every traffic, one lane, everybody move!
Two words, Mos Def, black jack, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game point lock, long pump cocked
We won't stop, everybody move!
Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters (Throw your hands up high)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
And keep ya hands up bustless, busters (Till they reach the sky)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
Hey yo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide
Cause I, rep that, till I, fucking die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics
Go get his rhyme like, should of been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, player hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"
Screaming, Jesus save me
You know how the game be
I can't let em change me
Cause on Judgment Day, you gon' blame me
Look God, it's the same me
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (oh)
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (oh)
From the bottom to the top
So only place to go down
And keep ya hands up bustless, busters (Till they reach the sky)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (oh)
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh)
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap kittens into two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
My God, two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free young bars, fresh men of the Roc
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
And broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
Have you screaming out four words "Send for the Lord"
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad
Throw (red) Your (white) hands (blue) Up (black)
Throw (calm) Your (down) hands (move) Up (back)
Throw (motherfuckers) your (asking) hands (who is) up (that)

High! (an show it to 'em like)
Baby, It's me... Maybe I bore you
No, No it's my fault cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby Puffy, Jay Z
Could all be better for you
Cause all I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)
Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like 
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are the cause
All I could do was love you
Baby when i used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to 
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah)
Oh! I used to (wheeen I used to)
Love you (used to... Love you)

You're gonna miss me now... 
(Grazie a *Star* per questo testo)
[Somebody Talking]
Yeah
Yo...let me, let me, let me, let me tell you why - why
This kitten...why we dedicated this song to this kind of kitten
Cuz number one, duke is drivin' in the motherfuckin' projects
With a - with a Sebring, and with - with a rag off
Y'na'mean? Y-you not ballin' like that play-boy
Straight up, then the bitch you got playin' shotgun
Like, I used to serve that bitch, c'mon
Really really good, I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack as kitten..
[Common]
Wack kittens...I don't even like to be around 'em
Give 'em dap or pound 'em
See 'em out they houndin' dawg
Singin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Singin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
kitten I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin' wack asses
I emcee as free as 'Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin' to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldn't be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a kitten then I pass to K
[Kanye West]
The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these kittens is wack 'n' eh
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most these kittens don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY
You was wit mAY (me) she said "Who's the sissAY?"
And even if they did wanna get bizzAY
Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg
Just keep it right thurr like ChingAY
Yo girl don't like me how long has shee been gAY
Spanish girls tell ya "No hable ingle"
And everbody wanna run to me for they singlAY (single)
It's funny how these wack kittens need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you I'd kill myself
[HOOK - Kanye West (Singing Voice)]
(Wack kitten) Wake up in the morning dawg, and you a
(Wack kitten) I'd kill myself if I was that
(Wack kitten) Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack kitten) Even if you flossin' rocks you still
(Wack kitten) You can't do it dawg you's a
(Wack kitten) Bitin' ass, bitch ass, trick ass
(Wack kitten) Even your daughter says "My daddy's a - "
(Wack kitten - You wack kitten!)
[Consequence]
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you
That's how you know ya flow is weak
Cuz you only got them there to 'Say Yes' like Floetry
The clique that I oversee ain't impressed by ya poetry
You're the place you're supposed to be
You ain't ain't comin' close to me
It ain't that you underrated
It's more thatn you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a  lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is, Murder, Death, Kill
But you never shot nothin', never have, never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems
[Talib Kweli]
In the beginnin', God created man in his own image
I'm 'bout to tell you how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business kittens don't forget it
Cuz a wiseman can shoose to get ignorant with it
Na'mean - you all can get it I'm conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these kittens all identity crisis
All day talkin' that shit like you hold a gat, right?
The trip you on must be short cuz you pack light - act right
You got it twisted tellin' kittens that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen Ive
Start speakin' New ?Wopian? and followin' Malachi
Oh, anything would rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug kittens wanna rap
And all these rap kittens wanna thug
And all ya'll fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
kittens back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'ma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack kitten, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got
Not that I'm wylin' or even promote violence
It's just you're fuckin' up my high, can a kitten smoke in silence?!
[HOOK]
(Gonna take you to the glory, oh I can't study war)
Now where the south side, now where the west side
Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatella Versace
That's Louis Vuitton's bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And, hey please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, roc-a-chain instead of a wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van it's easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy
I did it for the glory
Now where the south side, now where the west side
What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of no-doze
Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that two-door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skinny ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
O' hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious, fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these kittens soon as the chorus hit
Now where the south side, now where the west side
Yeah I'ma stop killing these kittens soon as the chorus hit
These haters be killing themselves they wanna come and get the glory
Yo, this sound like some movie shit right?
Get ya popcorn, get ya condiments, you don't wanna miss nothin, ok listen
[Verse 1]
They call me Edward Scissorhands cuz i'm tryin to cut
She claim she got cramps, I'm gone get you to suck
And you not gon use ya teeth ya hear?
You gon find out What Lies Beneath right here
The Preachers Wife don't give head? Get a divorce man
The kids been callin you the headless horseman
Like Sleepy Hollow see she swallow
Suck like ol girl got booed at Apollo
13 Ghost use my Hollow Mans for Friday 13th
You be Ghost, Backdraft from the toast
kittenz who drop names is, oh so shameless
Get a chain thats stainless, they Almost Famous
My bling got 'em callin me, Lord Of The Rings
The Shining make it hard for her to Do The Right Thing
But I Don't Say Word, I'll never tell
Until you get a Kanye beat, you'll never sell
[Chorus]
I'm livin a movie, not livin by rules
It's just a movie, don't lose ya cool
1,2 Ye comin for you, 3,4 better lock your door
5,6, 7,8, 9,10 never sleep again
[Verse 2]
Shits deeper, than The Sleepers
Jeeper Creep-up on your block and cops Clock-us
Try to Baller Block-us, use Absolute Power
You gave him 9 1/2 Weeks, why you tryin to Rush Hours huh?
And in The Cell don't drop soap in the showers huh
They try to give me Life, I'm out in a hour huh
Back on the block wit more Juice than Pac
Makin Mo' Money cuz of The, The, The, The Roc
[Chorus]
I said some shit like, umm, you in my things like Suicide Kings
There's only Three Kings, Me, Myself and Irene, you know what I'm sayin
[Pusha T]
Re-Up Gang Pusha
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it muthaf-cker
Yes
All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my shine into Moses
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them civil rights sposes
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op this priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
Ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the shower posse
Gone! 
(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it m-therf-cker
[Kanye West]
I'm here, it's the misogyny
Bad bitches massaging me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don't judge me, ugh, for the following
Fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
Take of that Givenchy and let's get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Cruncy
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy it's a sin
But if it falls in your lap it's a blessing
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Had used the main leathers (leathers, leathers, leathers)
[Cyhi The Prynce]
Cyhi, Cyhi, Yeah
Boy, we looking for trouble
Maybe if we wasn't black then we wouldn't have struggled
Player, all I got is trap kittens and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle
Got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
So I'm running through them circles, 
Boy I'm looking like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in 'cause kittens was looking
I've tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog I'm good for a scuffle
Don't be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I've tooken a couple
Feds asking kittens questions but I wouldn't rebuttal
'Cause I'm Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn't play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain't nothing silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I'm eating off of rather yellow gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don't get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like a yellow road
[Big Sean]
GOOD, I do it
B.I.G. Sean Don kitten
(But you found it mutherf-cker)
Bitch
I'm in, that no-smoke sec' rolling motherf-cking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you're not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don't need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stack's in my trousers
(Boy)
New double-D's smashed in her blouses
F-ck a hotel, my kitten we rent houses (houses)
My kitten, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I'm just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy
I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, dish it, look like CPR
'Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I'm snapping like yo' ass just finished a poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile, I'm chilling with all these kittens, counting all this money you ain't
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a BIG before the Dime
Greet me wit a middle finger when you see me
It's cool, 'cause I can't see yo' ass from this side of the TV muthaf-cker
[J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is putting fear in all the older ones
Down played me to downgrade me like they don't notice son
Your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in 'em
F-cking hoes while teaching kittens to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph's son
High as f-ck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I'm better than Hov, but I'm the closest one
Heard you looking for trouble, what, I'm supposed to run?
Yo' bitch invited me inside her, ain't I supposed to cum?
Got kittens that'll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of heaven's gate, fronting like you know someone
Talking hard, but y'all still ain't push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain't pussy
F-ck it, everybody can get it
When you're this hot, everybody's a critic
But when you're this high everybody's a midget
All this mean mugging from kittens that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch
And you don't want no problems on some math class sh-t
So check the young genius out
F-ck the World, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real sh-t is what you been fiending 'bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming 'bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout
[End]
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hood rats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find
Yeah I always find
Yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off

Run away fast as you can
Twenty four seven, three sixty five, 
Pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, 
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your best move, 
You could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that mothafuckin' top off
Split and go where? 
Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty bitches in the baller-kitten matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know it did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know where I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douche bags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake sleep isn't new
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will

Mrs. So Fly crash lands in my room
Can't waste no time she might leave soon
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will
Wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will
I'm cold 
I'm cold

Yeah

I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is farewell
I got my life and its my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door (door, door, door)
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And that you know (that you know)
Tell every one that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know (that you know)
Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go

Well know you know,

And that's one thing that you know

The clouds is in my vision

All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A. every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot sex
And Hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feelin' myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows, I'm callin'
I'm callin'
(Yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to

And I'll be tryin' to come around my girl actin' like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get ‘em a clone
He said, yeah, you know, you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here, is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3L-dub, I'm callin'
I'm callin'
(Yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to

What up Pam how your little man doin' in New Jersey
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton
Before I mark the plane make sure, you cop them trees to spark up
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You lookin' good in that one showin' off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty hate to show off your titties for silly classes
'Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time
I'm callin'

Be with, no one, but me, baby
Reliving the past
Yuh lost
Rock star bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause kittens got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
I brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity 
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it. 
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it) 
No, we have no money 
We are sharin' jeans. 
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on. 
How many cars do we own? (None!) 
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!) 
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car? 
Yes, we will. 
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me! 
(We can't afford no gas!) 
Say it! 
(We can't afford no gas!) 
So we ain't drivin'!
Feat. GLC
[Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, heavy hitters fo' life
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself, they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Hoes from on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man, no snitchin' man
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen man
Last 9.11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pulled out my map
Not it's course 9.11 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, but at least one that Annette have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my kittens about to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn Kanye (Kanye) Kanye!
Now hold up
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
Now you say it (ain't nobody messin' with you at all)
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as you?
(When the album comin' out?) Man the peoples is askin'
Why'all don't model Adidas, just stick with the fashion
Why'all already got do' so just spit for the passion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fangs
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life, Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
Let the beat ride out for a minute
[GLC (Kanye West)]
Let's take it there, take it there man
It's not supposed to be...
(GLC where you at kitten?)
How many kittens you know put their life on the line and get signed
Did a few high crimes, almost got lifetime
After the sunshine you thinkin' it might count
How could I mic out, just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' kittens that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I hate with the pressin'
When I copied hounds it was my best investment
Dre got shot and it taught me a lesson
I'm stickin' kittens up and them rubbery masses
Mash like Batman minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy
Fo' different blues, man your outfit is crashin'
You ain't got no muscles dude you weakling bastard
Man look at your haircut
Mm hmm, mm hmm, no, your hair sucks
How many kittens you know is really heavy hitters
'87 go getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and ye
And offers to sell and yell, uh
[Chorus: Kanye West]
I think I just fell in love with a porn star 
Turn the camera on, she a born star 
Turn the corners in a foreign car 
Call the coroners do the C.P.R. 
She gave that old kitten an ulcer 
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh) 
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh) 
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh) 
Move down town cop a sweet space (uh) 
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what) 
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh) 
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah) 
[Chorus]
Have you lost your mind 
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line 
No more drugs for me 
Pussy and religion is all I need 
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life 
Never in your wildest dreams 
Never in your wildest dreams 
In your wildest 
You can hear the loudest screams 
Comin' from inside the screen 
You a wild bitch 
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy 
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy 
Or do anal, or do a gang bang 
It's kinda crazy, it's opposite the same thing 
Well I guess a lot of kittens do gang bang 
And if you run trains, we all in the same game 
Run away slaves all on a chain gang 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
[Chorus]
One day I'm gon' marry a porn star 
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard 
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids 
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the brides maid s
She wanna roll play, 'till I roll over 
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day 
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar Day 
Laurenta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the change 
That's a dress of her back and told her get away 
How can they say they live they life wrong 
When you never fuck wit' the lights on 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
(fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on) 
Have you lost your mind 
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line 
No more drugs for me 
Pussy and religion is all I need 
Grand my hand 
Baby we'll live a hell of a life 
I think I fell in love with a porn star 
And got married in the bathroom 
Honeymoon on the dance floor 
And got divorced by the end of the night 
That's one hell of a life
We broke, broke broke phi broke 
(We ain't got it) 
Broke, broke, broke phi broke 
(We ain't got it) 
Don't spend no money 
Ain't got no clothes 
Ain't got no cars 
Ain't got no hos 
We broke, broke, broke phi broke 
(We ain't got it) 
Broke, broke, broke phi broke 
(We ain't got it) 
Got no money (got no money) 
We got no clothes (got no clothes) 
Ain't got no cars (got no cars) 
Can't get no hos 
We broke, broke, broke, broke, broke 
Buncha kittens 
Broke, broke, broke, broke, broke!
But it's too late, it's too late
He gone
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay! Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way
Too late, we gone, we strivin' home
Gone, we ride on chrome
It's too late
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin' on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin' over babysitters like, "Bitch, it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Are-are-are-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone
We strivin home, gone
I ride on chrome
We strivin' home, gone
Killa, I ride on chrome
Knock knock, who's there
Killa Cam, Killa who
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin' to the dealer
No concealin', no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, kittens still doin' puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all kittens want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just goin' tell 'em (Too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (Gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (Too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you want to see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin' like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin' my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin' alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now
We strivin' home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that
Cause
I been pourin' out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented "Gone With the Wind," cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a kitten talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone
I'm
Ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me want to get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin' it all behind
Kanye step away from the limelight, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin' over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18 year old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirror
How we out in Europe, spendin' Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin' the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone
(Kanye West)
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real MC
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Oooooooooooh
(Kid Cudi)
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(Kanye)
Such an easy mornin', we on a ride
And I'm feelin' smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playin' that bullshit
They don't want black people to think at trial
He think he live
(Common)
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode
Eyes low'd, I let the skies hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across
(Kanye)
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's Fashion Week
And the weather wasn't barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, forever we hot
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop)
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop! )
(This goes out to the allcore hip-hop)
(Can't stop! Yooou can't stop! )
(Pusha T)
As 'Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He's heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Sellin' kilos through your iPod nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy, look at Marbury's handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, somethin' like Breyers
Euro tank top, Dior inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
(Eyuck! ) I'm 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with 28
While haters wish death 'pon me, that's many men
Yeah, and if you slaim you on your paper route
Stop talkin', motherfucker, pull your paper out
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
(Big Sean)
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don't worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a kitten rep that Westside (Westside! )
Westside, Westside! 
So te-te-tell who the freshest of 'em all?
They claimin' that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my balls
A kitten seen the fresh like I'm headed to the fall
MC hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As to Bs to Cs
All over double Ds, I be absent all week
This is for my kittens, all the ones I ride for
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door
Hold on: That's the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my kittens nutted on her everything
(Charlie Wilson)
And let me hear you say ahhhh
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Let me hear you say ahhhh
Va-va-va-va-va-va
Va-va-va-va-va-va
(Kanye)
Ay, we promised
Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evenin'
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
Are you?
Ready to go?
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
I know the city gettin' ready for me
I know the city gettin' ready
End

Now throw your hands up in the sky
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good
Welcome to the good life
Where kittenz that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lowry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good
Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got more (Ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
(I wish a kitten would)
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life
Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmamma ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
Right now I can see it so vivid 
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
People you never got a chance to say bye to 
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams 
Into real life, if you try to 
So close, but so far 
And so far, no cigar 
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today 
So I'm a live like there's no tomorrow 
No goodbye 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
Uh, to you 
If I part my heart will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
My art will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 
[Repeat: x3]
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and 
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my kittens get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a kitten ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, kittens cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest kitten, I must have missed it!
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said, 
"I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, 
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
kitten hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
[Intro:]
kittenz is gossipin' across the city,
They don't know why Gin & 'em ain't comin' to get me
So I hit the block and do about sixty,
And I put my glocks' to 'dem like blaow, blaow, blaow
[Verse 1:]
I'm fin to get on this TV and put shit down,
I ain't fin to let these light skin kittenz come back in style
I'm fin to turn this class clown shit to crazy-D
They told my mamma I was bipolar
Kanye to the year, you heard the name
Tracks plus racks, finna murder the game
Uh, can I get it?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
All these is believe and breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only different story, fuck that up
Iceberg flows, I gotta pose
Every whip but the studio
In the hospital dissin, flow is very sick
Plus very rich, very thick chain
Very thick til I got every bitch
20’s at the bottom carry the 6
If I cock back and shot on my band with precision
You can’t hate this, with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
But she taste this, rather taste this
Taste my aiming, watch me H this
You whack rap, catch me a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
We stand to my tims, grab my laces
Got loofs on, the only type noose on em
Define how like triple goose in it
What the fuck I gotta do? Another truth in?
See it don’t really matter what yall brooling
Yall ain’t satisfied til we shoot you
So if somebody gotta die tell me who want it
That Chi Town, Southside booth, we on it, we on it
* send corrections to the typist
[Intro: woman (Kanye West)]
(first of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(you got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(what else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil'
Kim (yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' these beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lotta clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
Cuz I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"
[Hook: Kanye West]
Cuz I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on "Chyna Doll", I woulda did them beats for free
Cuz only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D Dot was just teasin' me
I bought somw earrings like Baby that may be fake
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can hit 'em or Nas with Lazy K
And lady may, maybe hey
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a kitten that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her
[Hook: Kanye West]
I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See I came back for you
Cuz any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh Trina?
Oh I'm be right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to-
I ain't feelin' that verse
Oh, it can't be G.O.O.D music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now I'm hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B
But you kittenz gon' get in 'til you get to Miami
GLC gon' be stoned as Angie
I be Don C, Johnny Patrone and me
It's a celebration, bitches, more bottles of champaign
I ain't in love with the same stripper that sprung T
Pain and all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap, man
Dawg, I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest
Stuntin' out the middle of nowhere like Vegas
From the Chi, the city of hella haters
Where we keep risin' to the top like elevators
Hi haters, I'm back of hiatus
I feel just like you, I mean even I hate us
Turn the radio down I mean every song
Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian
Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on
Until Khaled turned up the volume
Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin'
Nas done told you come on homie we major
Really Doe told you hoes where we stayin'
G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playin'
Dawg, it can't be G.O.O.D. music the Grammy Family
A little bit a stuntin', flickin', dawg, it ain't deep
I'm only tryin' to spend what they claim you can't keep
Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side
Like Lake Shore Drive, The Grammy Family
It's the Cons fool, word
No, it can't be G.O.O.D. music my Grammy Family
Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry
Now we hoppin' out the limo or either the Lam B
And after music meeting wit evenings with Angie
It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me
And we be in Miami so when they spot me in Bentley
It's gon' be a stampede 'cuz we be racin' Bentleys
No different than Grand Prix's
Fam please, don't make my man squeeze
And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed
I started independent with owners from land speed
But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed
And since I got my shot like I was call and man be
I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B
We'll be waitin' in the telly like Jamie and Fancy
Prolly paintin' they nails in nuthin' but they panties
And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby
Headed to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby
They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath
And I know my kitten Ye told you we was the best dressed
I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step
So what ya'll wanna do when it comes to that next check
And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is
So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is
The Grammy Family
On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night
Celebrate tonight, oh, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
Provide a new coffin
You don't seek murder like this this often
God level
God level
Our father
Might as well make a new casket
God level
God level
God level
You see sharks in the water
Then they try to do nothin' but put cocks in your daughter
Don't say nothin' 'bout what Ye said
Don't move, motherfucker, play dead
Yeah, we cool, motherfucker, yeah, yeah
God level
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
[Chorus]
I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my Caeser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all OK man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Nori, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say
[Hook 1]
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say, hey, hey, one day
You'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear
No you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face
And I hear you say
[Hook 2]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got the love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand
[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly
[Hook 3]
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me...
[Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
'cause I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed 'cause of the whips and cream
'cause when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal kitten when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on it's way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"
[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the word "go"
Couldn't watch another kitten get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word
[Kanye West]
'cause she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me
[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Artist: Kanye West
Album:  College Dropout Unreleased
Song:   whole life
[Verse 1]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama benz JEEP
We'll put 50 I get this on the first take
But that 50'll break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim
Had a girl nickname sprewell 'cause when I tried to stop
She still made me spend
Back when Avies was in, my dog crazy kid had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again
And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said “This car real old”; I told her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club
And get a girl that's into the fitness
Tryin to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get insiiiide
[Chorus]
Now I been hustling my whole life
Tryin to get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I been polly'n with this one girl that claim “I gotta work tomorrow”
But tonight's the night, so poor another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doin fine
[Verse 2]
Spit it till you say lil West's a little beast
And make the middle west blow like the Middle East
PEACE
Please, what I gotta win 5 Grammy's before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys
If I can't bone, I get a clone, get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She vibin, don't stop her there, told me that she love the Roc so much 
She drove all the way to far Rockaway, for a Rocawear
More populaire, 'cause I abracadabra'd my Nissan
To a car throwin the peace sign, PEACE
Damn that's like the same line I used in the first verse
But w-w-w-wait it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K, before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew's CK
In a CL like U-C-K, that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
Im tryna find a crazy fe-male wit a cutee face
I big pimp her on the the D.L. like UGK
And then I told her
[Chorus]
Wise men say
Wise men say
Wise men say
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
It's so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is about
Do you think I sacrificed real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy
It's funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep runnin
It's like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina... 
For everybody that sees you to say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you to say 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you cry and say 'you oughtta laugh'
You oughtta laugh
I just want to be a real boy, 
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes... 
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I can't find her no more, 
I can't find her no more I cant... 
The only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay... 
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream, 
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the TV screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what tf for a real boy
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say
[Chorus: Twista]
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
'Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought
[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a kitten for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a kitten off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking it's a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
kittenz claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003
(Throw it up if you...)
[Chorus] - 2X
(featuring Common)
(Hook)
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm, I-I-I-I'm
I'm Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card?
I turned around and replied why yes,
But I prefer the term African-American Express
(Hook)
La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me
Brains, power and muscle like Dame, Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say, There's something I might play
A beat I might make might make they life change
And save their whole deal, Their wrist is on chill
They house is on hill, You could be Lauren Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now you just prayin
(Hook)
[Common]
You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real kittenz see the light got fat girls eating right
[Outro]
Ha ha we in this bitch
It's Common and Kanye y'all kittenz know what time it is
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up?
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff
Foreal(Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way
That's why I had to rap on this 'cause
His tracks is Better Than Yours
My tracks is Better Than Yours
Just Blaze tracks is Better Than Yours
You can have one but we all gonna

That's all
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Lupe Fiasco]
Head to the sky, wings raised in
She's about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But aint no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she'll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you'll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling's as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
How could you do it
How could you do it
[Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can't it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I'm testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Y" sometimes like a f-cking vowel
But hitting tree's everyday like a f-cking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now
[Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Pharrell]
Explain yourself, how you sound like me?
The muthaf-cking skateboard P
Knowing that your mee lo
Playing games like you're cee-lo
In a tight situation like speedo's
You can have it your way like Carlito
My kitten will be happy to give you torpedos
And have you car twisted like a blunt
For you faggot a-s kittens that like to front
I'm on some BBC bape sh-t
I'm on some cake sh-t
In the kitchen with the heat making beats in my apron
You hating and you want to erase it
Close your eyes when you know you can't take it
My flow interupts your homeostasis
I Rolls Royce it on a regular basis
You talk street sh-t it sound like sweet sh-t
Straight liquorice you kittens sound ticklish
80k large for the Hermes dream
Coke n crop in all your magazines
Hunger strike yourself, look like Celine
Dion, me and my kittens like frion
You b-tches on my pecan b-tch
She got an a-s you can eat on
Try to play tough like the leather on a Vuitton
I hit it til I could seat on
Try to get her freak on
Ask me to R Kelly ya and get pee'd on
I said it aint me maam
That 8 behind me still got the burner
Yes the enzo is stilll black like Sojourner
Truth, I mighta just loosened a tooth
Spittin' what I did in the booth
I'm out, pooof! 
[Lupe Fiasco]
Carrera, raised in a teenage mutant ninja turtle era
Waanna bear n tell the truth, I dare ya
Ya lie, so eat these whole bottle of these jalapeno peppers
For terror made in america too live
F-ck the property or give me my props properly
High off life this high technology, DeVry
I rep Muhammad Ali more like rapology
My policy's not to be dishonestly deprived
So gimme that, gimme that, keep going
Where my city at, I'm like steak and fries but never die
They wanna Ghostface wanna be me
But they will post haste follow me into the after life
That means you going right after I've
But I'm the hero sort of like Jack Sparrow
So some way some how I have survived 
Who is he that we see coming over the tides
In a speed boat, boat load of pride
Full of rum, dress shirted and mastermind tie
He what happens when rappping and fashion collide
So OMG is the "C" from the C-R-S LOL'ing at you haters 
[Kanye West]
Yes, MR West turn that new child rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus we through with a tyrannosaurus
Tyrone it's been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone
We'll take the plane rub his nose in cocaine
There's hoes in magazines you lame sayin you lame
And for the hate in advance, pull down your pants
Make 'em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue, business manager's Jewish
And if I get sued my lawyers Jews
Some girls do, grab the cojones
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra Loan-us
Brand new ferrari's I gotta make the donuts
C-R-S is like a hip hop Chris's bonus
kittens is hating on the internet I couldn't tell
I was too busy rapping GOOD as hell
I was too busy flying, parasail! 
Tell collect to get the new sh-t that Paris sell
Tarantino, Da Vinche, gettin' Benji's, get half off Fendi
Half of that's to Cindy's
Hoped out the spaceship on my Mork and Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dork's offend me
Props in New York but Chi town's the city
Get my city hoochie's Gucci, Monica Bellucci's
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendi's?
I'm so ultra I'm even over Oprah
But let me check your account, haha no sir
Don't stop, don't stop...
(Mr. West) Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
And I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love, like a rob would say
Before you ask me to get a job today, 
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the Government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah O'Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these kittens from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And kittens guns a clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, one day that ya see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my 'lil cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too kitten-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm stickin' around
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin' ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say, (Nothin' ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)
Cause every worthless word we got more far away, 
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, 
It hurts but it may be the only way
Order, huh
Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism, but most of all we at war with ourselves
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)
You know what the Midwest is?
Young and Restless
Where restless kittens might snatch ya necklace
And next these kittens might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these kittens who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
Saying "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!"
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so long
So long
(Jesus Walks with me)
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me, with me, with me)
The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
[Intro: ODB (K. West)]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! {*continues until chorus comes in*}
Yo this is Dirt McGirt, I'm chillin' wit Kanye West
He's killin' y'all kittenz on the beats
He's killin' y'all kittenz on the tracks
(Where ya plaques at dog?)
The game is officially over!
Go kill yaself!
[Chorus: ODB (K. West)]
Now take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not mothafucka, it's The Roc mothafucka!
[Kanye West]
Keep the Receipt mothafuckas!
Now y'all gon' stop talkin' that shit that you talkin'
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the Hell so gon' afford that coffin?
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the shot since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My kittenz had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove kittenz postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters
Dog, kittenz had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards.. HUMPH!
Now after all that it took
I made it to The Roc, I'm guess I ain't as dumb as you look
[Chorus x2]
[Kanye West]
Now.. I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you kitten's tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rappin' and I can't do nothin' for ya, man
S.G'll hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov', if you ain't Cam'
Damn, I know you say he's killin' hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feelin' hisself
Yup, just 'cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who ya hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
You goin' through movin' critters, now who's laughin'?
The best producer that rap better than the rappers
[Chorus x2 - last line by K. West the 2nd time]
[Ol' Dirty Bastard (K. West)]
Aftermath still makin' them hits, kitten?
Lunatics still makin' them hits, kitten?
So So Def still makin' them hits, kitten?
Bad Boy still makin' them hits, kitten?
Wu-Tang still makin' them hits, kitten?
Ruff Ryders still makin' them hits, kitten?
(Cash Money) still makin' them hits, kitten?
Dirt McGirt still makin' them hits, kitten
Yo yo the game is over, go kill yaself!
Go kill yaself.. kitten!
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more!
Til the casket drops
Third times a charm right?
Ha ha, come on!
I'm kinda like a big deal
It's unbelievable you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow runnin' on Big's heels
My life after death, Big ain't get to see how this feels!
Third time's a charm baby
After two classics another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessin' to blow a hundred thou' in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha ha we're ballin, drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin'
Re-up is the gang and I'm all in!
To the powder and the flame I have fallin'
Get money, blow money is my callin'
Yugch! Watch a kitten burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the
It's more than a feeling ain't it?
I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a kitten be
Spittin' fire on the P-J in my P-J's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like T-J
Y'all ain't peep? I said Marshall's we play
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction!
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I bee hop in the ring, kittens ya cash in
It's like stoppin' a train,
kitten think he's stoppin' my reign
Talk slick while droppin' my name?
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'
The C-4-S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you so
They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal
[Man]
Hey Jimmy where you going?
[Jimmy]
I don't know where I'm going.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say "Dad, why don't you work?", 
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, 
And I was actually in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have. 
These are documented.
My father left them for me.
And I'm going to leave them to my kids.
I'm going to learn too.
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.
Who has that
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a kitten cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

Open back up last time

I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hands of God
So y'all better quit playing with God
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper who compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass kittens who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass kittens to bite you
I don't wanna hear what some kittens might do
Old kittens mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody else had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa es su casa
That's our costra nostra
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God
Ain't no way I'm giving up on my god
Fraud kittens, y'all kittens, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
(Woo!) That's rare kitten, (Woo!) Ric Flair kitten
(Woo!) The power's in my hair kitten, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair kitten
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful kittens, I don't like
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like (Bang, bang)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like (This Chicago, kitten!) 
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike (Whoa!)
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite (Whoa!)
But I never hit a woman never in my life (Eh!)
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phif' (Eh!)
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice (Whoa!)
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice (Whoa!)
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice (Eh!)
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right? (Eh!)
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes (Whoa!)
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life (Whoa!)
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night (Eh!)
Free Bump J, real kitten for life (Eh!)
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that kitten nice (Whoa!)
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right? (Whoa!)
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like, a snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that kitten that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
We are not one and the same, kitten I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my kittens holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my kittens and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
I done sold purp' (purple) I done sold white (white)
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas
A fuck kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch kitten, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
I'm the one, baby
Yeah, I'm the one, baby

You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mm hm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
'Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip, yeeuum!
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here 'til it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
I told Detroit I'ma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, 
But it's Ferrari's I gotta drive I'm on HBO with my entourage, 
I'm 5'9' fuck a 9 to 5 I need a hundred million no compromise
I'm a double X L kitten, 
Magazine and condom size see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day, I did it
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'mma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one (One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my kittens, call it profit share
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, kitten thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my kitten went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all
I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass kittens in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here kitten so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
kittens treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace it was really kind, 
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time
Fuck yeah, awesome yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace it was really kind, 
Of awesome it's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time

Woo! You will never need another lover
Woo! Cause you a milf and I'm a motherfucker
Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'
I'm pa rum pa pum pumin' all on your stomach
Yeah, tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' strippers to a super C.E.O
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as hell with all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good (OH!) when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin' [?] very weary
Yup! On the 35th of Neverwary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I pregnated your mouth, girl, ooooh
That's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
Fuckin' all over the house, girl, we just messed up a brand new couch, girl
You ain't on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck that
[Verse 2: Beyonce]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you
[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Verse 3: Beyonce]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washrags, he wear it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body Benz serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good-good
[Bridge]
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Verse 4: Jay Z]
Hold up, that D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
Now eat the cake, Anna Mae said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we going in, we be all night
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
[Bridge]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
[Hook]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww
[Verse 1: Common]
They say a kitten lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Kara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the kitten wit dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My kittenz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin "Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:] "Uh!" (hey!)
[Verse 3: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether it's weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That kitten's back," uh...
[Chorus]
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
Turn it up...(A little louder) 
I can't live my I 
I can't live my life this way 
Continuely get high 
Instead of runnin round lock one bird down 
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get by (alright) 
Show no respect can't live that way 
Ya hold my cheque can't live that way 
without my chick on deck can't live that way 
They say what they like but I been that way 
Our moves calculated through the lense 
Almost here 
Success will be the best revenge 
And now from Clint East to Kanye West 
The sun can't chill but everday it sets (every day) 
This time I made up my mind 
This time I'm deck on the grind 
I know there's thing in my life 
That I'ma let go startin tonight 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't li my I, I can't li my 
I can't live my life this way 
I can't li my I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't li my (this way) I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't li my (this way) I, I can't li my (this way) 
I can't live my life this way (this way) 
Look down 
Go ahead flip a coin so the game can start 
Believe I know the drama give name to part 
I know before the hot flame came the spark 
It's like before the pop fame came to pour 
but this industry will play with your life man 
They're playin with rent, food water and lights man 
That's why I rock the beats like that old totty T Jam 
The batter ram then i'm off to Amsterdam 
To rest up a strength to deal with this weight 
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate 
I dedicate this to Jam Master J 
Run DMC showed me how to walk this way
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
Too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the,
Chi-Town what's going on man
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry the Mr. H says that the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her life support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru,
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys are Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um, I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dog don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man
(Let the sun shine)
Yeah, yeah, it's a brand new day, y'all
(Let the sun shine)
Turn me up in the top a little bit, dog
Want you to know, want you to hear this one
(The sun's shinin')
Loud an' clear, bright an' early, listen
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you, mother fuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump an' fake
But dog, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business an' I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin', this is not for you
On my J.O. with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
An' it's been like that since the day, yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck, do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low
(Let the sunshine)
Standin' in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn kitten, I am, Black Dante
(Let the sunshine in)
That kitten, that dude, black people, let's move
(The sun's shinin')
Shout out to my man, Talib Kweli, yes
We on top a, top a, shout a, shout a, check it out
Slim kitten that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim an' more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, 'Hail Mary', full of grace
kittenz come in an' shoot up the place
An' make you pull up your face
The deck, Im'ma pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State
Where it ain't no escape
Two four seven, seven one eight
An' thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle an' stay
To the states, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
Like a long time man of the way
(Let the sun shine)
You understandin' me straight?
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
(Let the sunshine in)
It's what it is, what it is
An' thats what it is, you see? Ha, fire
(The sun's shinin')
'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception an' sharper picture
Revolve around God an' involve with kittenz
These elements above all my scripture
An' make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn, it don't matter if you holler or whisper
You're comin' through clear 'cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya
Yo, brothers an' sisters, fathers an' mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the kittenz
Rebel guerrillas, the ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra ordinary an' plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move on
I move in, an' y'all must move on
(Let the sun shine)
'Cause I move to strong an' I know what my feet move for
Make it go without a brand new car
(Let the sunshine in)
I was fresh without a brand new song
An' give a fuck about what brand you are
(The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles an' standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all
Be good to your families, dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody need family, dog
Raise your hands, you understand me, pa
That's what it is, that's my man
Family an' my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle
Masada Malia, Son Dial la, Magic Mel
(Let the sunshine in)
Life is real
All the real soldiers, black people, we family y'all
(Let the sunshine in)
(The sun's shinin')
Let it be bright
[Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion
Ay yo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus and y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
(?) I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it huh?
My swagga is McJagga
Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it
Why he so mad for? why he gotta have it?
Cuz I slave my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa! 
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine?
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa!
Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon
[Jay-Z]
Gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans
Cuz my knots don't fit
No one on the corner
Gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans
Cuz my knots so thick
U can learn how to dress
Just by
Jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Jocking jocking my fresh
Follow my steps
It's the road to success
Where the kittens think u thorough
And the girls say yes
But I can't teach u my swag
U can pay for school
But u can't buy class
School of hard knocks
I'm a grad
All blue Yankee
Is my graduation cap
HOOOOOOOOVVVVAAA
Dipping different rovas (?)
Wipping with the soda (?)
HOOOOOOOOVVVVAAA
Could u even have any doubt 
after doutbt it was ova.
[Lil' Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Chuch! 
But I'm too clean for these boys
I require what I desire
I got stripes Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas
Run up in yo shit just me no moss
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these 4 guys
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal
And my Ju-elz blue and yellow
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write yo name on the bullet make u feel special
HA! What the f**k you boys talking about?
I know it's us cuz we the only thing you talk about! 
and im gone.. bye
[T.I.]
You go see weezy for the wordplay, 
Jeezy for the bird play, 
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy, 
All my verses picture perfect
And they meant to serve a purpose, 
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless, 
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous, 
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it, 
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is what another rapper do, 
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities, 
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that, 
But spitting real life on hot beats... I'm the truth at, 
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary, 
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary, 
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary SWAG!
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I want it, layaway or a deposit
My Dad'll say "when you see clothes close ya eyelids"
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'thing I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show you how we live
E'r'body want it but it ain't that serious
Mm hm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize, that you were a champion in their eyes?)
Your my devil your my angel, 
Your my heaven your my hell, 
Your my now your my never, 
Your my freedom your my jail, 
Your my lies your my truth, 
Your my war your my truce, 
Your my questions your my proof, 
Your stress and your my masseuse, 
Mama say mama say momma Dondas' son, 
Lost in this plastic life, 
Lets break out of this fake ass party and turn this into a classic night, 
If we die in each others arms, 
We'll still get laid in the after-life, 
If we die in each others arms we'll still get laid.

(Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
 
They try to tell me my chain broke the levy, 
Maybe cuz it's flooded, 
Why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin, 
My teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing, 
My teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin', 
While yall got all caps on?, 
Don Cheadle Time, 
Get extra black on em', 
Burn Hollywood burn, 
Take too long for the homies to get their turn, 
Probably be cremated before I get my urn, 
They try to tell that aliens built the pyramids, 
I swear life's a bitch on a period, 
For every instant cuz every hoe thinks you see, 
I made my jeweler add a few mo links, 
You can look at me and tell I don't care what nobody think, 
And my face always lookin' like somebody stink. 
(Chorus) my chain heavy yeah yeah my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy (repeat 2x) 
Here we go, like we should, 
Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
Here we go, like we should, 
Feel the sweat, on ya face, 
Alright okay, feel the sweat on ya face, h 
Ere we go, like we should, like we should, like we should 
What color was the skin that bared the cross, 
No matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off, 
How many caskets will we see in one lifetime?, 
That's why Miles Davis coping is mic time, 
I keep that notebook on my ottoman, 
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800's, 
Yall forget that I got called kitten on Twitter so many times, 
Man I lived that, 
Man I'm just trying to find out where to raise my kids at, 
Cuz they don't want where they crib at, 
Hey real tom lookin' for a nice park, 
Twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark, 
This is the flow that solar eclipses, 
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to, 
In this existence, 
Don't give up now just a little mo persistence, 
I want to thank Ice Cube and Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away huh, something might happen, 
This is the making of a masterpiece, so we broke out the chains and told the master peace.
[John Legend - Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now
[Kanye West]
I'm in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
If you work with my people, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call, out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower (Lara) Stone's walls
Jessica Gomes, yall, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I'm in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosia, Anja Rubik, 
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I'm very single
Abbey Lee, too I'm a freak boo
I'm wylin I'm on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen.
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I'm tryna eat out so what we going for dinner for
[Pusha T]
Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Tryna hide what's obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon coloured suits from the VMA's
Oh you was watching, who the f-ck wasn't
Me skip across that stage in 5 dozen
Yeah 60 grand for a minutes time
Italian vogue styled a kitten for a minute rhyme
Lets be clear and lets be fair
The best things in music's being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffins near
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Ryan Leslie]
It's time for a lesson in model behaviour
Damn, look at all the bad b-tches I gave you
Man I can see the flaws to your flavour
Look like wonder woman and still need a saviour
Maybe it's a billionaire maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur holding titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me.
[Lloyd Banks]
He ain't Kraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm
Fly clothes and Lear shows, type kind of stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I'm puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone
Must've been the liquor talkin', I'm beggin' the cups, "C'mon"
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler's poem
My sound's full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh)
kitten, make some money 'fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I'm back like a nine milli, runnin' New York City
See me clearly through the storm
The world's mine, sits pretty in my palm
Sean Don (Chandon?) as we continue on
[Chorus]
I got the World in my hands, the master plan
But I don't know why I keep calling
Why I keep all of these girls at my shows
They loving me but I don't know why
I keep calling
Why I keep calling you
[Kid Cudi]
kittens think they know I'm the guy with the story
They don't really know what's in my head, f-ckin' with me
How can I be better?
I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior, galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I'm off the nini
To the people who don't know Cud', know what?
Rose gold presidential on my boney wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, had her LC the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don't really matter, we escaping with our paper
"Hey ya", I'm on my Andre 3000
I'm all good now, a kitten don't need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when let me not reflect on the old sh-t
I'm on to the new act, on to my new script
B-tches better have they thoughts before approaching
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other kittens
Do things all before living, haters, copy, I'm the image
Haters, copy, I'm the image
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s Dee-ricious”
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeer's, just horses and a Panamera Porcshe
We on two fifth shopping, what the damage cost
I got your fam' while you bidding in the can up north
Woops, I’m at Niemens I hope they still got em
You want the thigh high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast cause Christ is born
We gon’ party all night til the lights come on
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Yeah, mom and dad I won't be home for the holidays
I’m over 800 miles away
In the city that's so pretty
Where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I’m sorry that I gotta stay
I’m with Ye at the Macy Day parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I’m in New York I’m still reppin' for the A
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
On the stoop of that Brownstone shoveling the brownstone
Santa’s on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Down town got me feeling like it’s Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like it's down home
Snow like sugar hill
Chains on wheels
We turn our two doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?
Oh, pause for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment
Where’s your NoDoz pills
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel
Hope you know those real
Okay my white girl Veronica
Black girl Monica
Got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up!
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
Lenox Ave to Saint Nick
Never seen St Nick
Just kittens selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
That's where the snow’s at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo’s
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah (My lawyers)
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood
All of the flashin’ lights
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Verse 1]
You don't need me to ever write
I read your last message at least 1000 times
At least 1000, at least 1000 times
Alright, alright, alright
Why did you ever listen to
People trying to hate on you
At least you know that's nothing new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby, you're awesome
So awesome
You look too good to be at work
You feel too good to ever hurt
I hope you ready for tonight
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert
You can't be still
You gotta move, you gotta dance
I gotta live, I gotta love
I got a hope, I got a chance
Cause baby, you're awesome
You don't need to listen to your manager
You're way too hot for them to handle you
Baby, not doing nothing? you
Came for something that I've got it
Why you fallin' on me
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park
You're so after dark
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right
Oh, you nnannanaa
I know you must be tired
From running through my mind
Can I come inside?
Cause baby you're awesome
Also, I'm also awesome, also
I'm also awesome
Y'all know
And I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you
Than something with somebody new
Stop everything you're doing now
Cause baby you're awesome
Don't let nobody bring you down
You're so awesome
You're so out the park, you're so after time
You're so breaking?, oh it feels so right
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
It's Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
It's ironic what's happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I would'nt have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil, 
I know it's a crappy deal, 
At least it came with a few toys, 
Like a Happy Meal, 
I'm spaced out dog, 
I be on that moontalk, 
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle, 
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib, 
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Benz bangles, 
I'm so anxious I'm gettin anxiety
Begging one of these f-ckin fashion houses to hire me, 
They say I've been an asshole, 
I said if you acquire me, 
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I'll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I'm not right dog, I'm slightly off, 
I'm Paranoid Like bonin' Raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that'll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should've had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down the time
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my line
I'm building a still
Down the time ooh
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Your my devil, your my angel
Your my heaven, your my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, your my jail
You're my lies, your my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
Your my questions, your my proof
Your my stress your masseuse
Mama say mama say mama gos-an
Lost in this plastic light
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid in that afterlife
If we die in each others arms
Still get laid yea
I'm up in the woods
(Run from the lights, run from the night
Run for your life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
Ya oh wow
Ya oh wow
Ya oh wow
Ya oh wow
Ya oh wow
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

But I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line

[Chorus]
I never liked you kittens
Who knew one day I'd be just like you kittens
Uh uh uh alright you kittens
Uh uh uh alright you kittens
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
He walked in our lives
I was only five
Superman pajama's I was super duper fly
Sitting here like why, he at least supersize
You know I scrutinise like who this newer guy
I'm my mama boyfriend I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when there wasn't
Trying to get to know homie just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me you just tryna f-ck my mum
We are the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces
The kids of bitter split ups
And baby sitters
Grand parents that don't know what to do with us
And the last thing I want to see is mama's new kitten
You old Old Spice wearing
Short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing
Church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Don't try to put me inline I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands of my mama how I need to got clearance
Yeah I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that would make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I scream out "I ain't going to sleep no time soon, 
And when I do I'm sleeping in my mama room"
I don't like you kitten
If I was old enough I would fight you kitten
I wanna run over you in my bike you kitten
Don't go to sleep at night you kitten
And it seems like I wasted time
If that's what it's all about
Mama if that's moving up than I
When I become my mama's boyfriends
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see I'm dating having problems of my own
Now that I'm grown the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another kittens child
He don't like his mama's boyfriend
Just like me don't wanna do the wrong thing
That's very un Spike Lee but he be like he go round his mama then
Cause when she here he be quiet
When she leave he be talking again
He be wylin again
Be calm I don't drink the drama
A sip of Dom Tyler-Perry-on
You gon marry my mom look
I don't read palms and I don't read psalms
And I did take little man to church
And took little man to school
Look littl eman kids don't make the rules
Even though I aint raised you
You your mama angel
Don't get it twisted baby boy I'll Ving Rhames you
[Chorus]
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
I say to u that u are my one an only
Never leave me lonely
Putcha body on me
And hold me close yeah
Lets take off to a place we aint neva been
And make love all night till da mornin

We the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us kitten
Cause I don't really trust kittens
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years

His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money
She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money

Should of got that insured got GEICO for ya money
If you ain't no punk holla We Want Prenup
We want prenup!, yeah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo ass she gone leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday he found out it wasn't his
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
But she ain't messing with no broke kittens
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger 
But she ain't messing wit no broke kittens
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head
Now I ain't saying you a gold digger you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's balling but yea that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo ass for a white girl
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head get down 
Get down girl go head
[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless..
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
[Chorus]
How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't goin' speak so
Why we up three A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me for
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
[Chorus]
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just goin' keep hatin' me
And we just goin' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm goin' take off tonight
Into the night
[Chorus]
Artist: Kanye West
Album: Unreleased Studio Tracks
Song: I Need 2 Know
[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know
[Verse 1]
I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn 
That white benz, dyke twins
I aint gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the kitten producing
The track that got you movin, this track got you movin
So crazy you don't know what you doin
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down ‘fo I pay for this room 'cause
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 2]
Now if you got it you got it
And if you don't then you prolly wont
Sissy kittenz call em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse em
By em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose em
Take em back to confuse em
So she don't know if she coming or going
'cause mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Back to show just frontin and flowin
Jewelry stuntin and glowin, this life is something I know it
And I been known to have a hoe or two
'cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin you
After that it's over boo, baby grab your coat and VOOM
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin and havin sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep em impressed
Let em seat in the Lex, never, eat em unless
That fuckin cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me
[Chorus x2]
Some glad morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life have flown
I'll fly away
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, O Glory
I'll fly away
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye
I'll fly away
Yo Jin, we good wit this one. 
Good looking Kanye.

2x
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is so basically the Chi M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now it makes perfect sense

We take turns doing our one twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all

Naw that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no!
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x

Polly want a Gucci Parka ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today hey
But anyway though she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low got play dough stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x
girl I don't wear Prada never met Gucci
Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change
I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke kitten racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And this rich kitten racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be kittens now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all kittens can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You kittens pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that kittens can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all kittens can't fuck with me
Y'all kittens can't fuck with Ye
Y'all kittens can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock kittens up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prisons
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long
You cannot survive
And I'm not dying
And I can't lose
I can't lose
No, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again
Too high)
Jamie Fox, featuring Kanye West
First Verse:
Last night me and my dogs was hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today, so it's all right
But all those ups and downs, turned me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
Then every record became our favorite song
And that is all that I remember
Chorus:
Cuz I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing, from Memphis Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
Second Verse:
When I woke up from last night's "salvatry"
Baby doll was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes was scattered every where
I got dress and got up out of there
But not before I call for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Every thing that I remember
Repeat Chorus: 2x
Bridge:
Extravaganza, Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes, it was
The things that I remember
Kanye West's Rap:
(And I remember)
Being at the bar
Trying to ask what that Hpyno hit fo'
Knowing that I can't afford to get mo'
Here's a broke kitten trick
Buy one bottle and sip slow
Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did
Come back when you get dough
A fish stick kitten
Now we messing with lobsters
We messing with Grammies
We messing with Oscars
You messing with that dranky drank
Plus you puffing on the stanky stank
In the morning, you g'on draw a blank
The hotel said that y'all was on one
My girl wasn't on shit
I picked the wrong one
Steady talking about I ain't like them other girls
Well tonite, I'm trying to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Neva meet 'cha mother girl
You know they love it, when you love them
And they tell they friends, girrrllllll
Repeat Chorus: 2x
Ad libs:
Kanye West - "You know, they're going to blame it on the drink"
"You know, that's just an excuse to do exactly what you want to do."
"J. Fox, Kanye to the"
"And the winners are"
"That's BSP, baby"
"There's a lot of Black Star Power in the room right now"
"Easy" "Easy" "Be very easy"
"Calm down, please"
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)
That's all them can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing a dat man do
Action thing yo a badman ting
I'm a badman you if know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)
We ah go smile pon court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J
That’s right I’m in it
(Should’ve known I would fall)
I’m in it
(Stepping on cracks on the floor)
That’s right
(And boys at your door)
That’s right I’m in it
(Well you need to fight for your own)
That’s right I’m in it
(Then don’t let me at your table)
I’m in it
(If you just gonna lay there)
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
(I'll be long gone, grab that ass, set your code)
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like Ah!
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all them can do (say wah, say wah))
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
That's all them can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing a dat man do
That's right I'm in it
(I'll be long gone, grab that ass, set your code)
Say you love who I
Lay it off, it off
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, when
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids and the wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the night life
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, getting head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playing
Uh, they don't see what I'm saying
Uh, they be balling in the D-League
Uh, I be speaking Swaghili
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put holes in everything else
"New God Flow," fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer (Woo!) write it in bold letters
They love a kitten's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Yay' as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him (Yughck)
(Matching Daytonas, rose gold on us)
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us (ooh!)
(But since you over do it, I’mma pour more)
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door
Shake that body, party that bod (That's rare kitten!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Rick Flare kitten!)
Shake that body, party that body (Yeah kitten!)
Come and have a good time with G.O.D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)
Shake that body, party that bod (Whoa!)
Shake that body, party that body (It's a new God flow kittens!)
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that kitten with Grand Marnier (Woo!)
(Woo!) They shitty shoppin' at Targét (Woo!)
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (Ay!)
Im ballin', Amar'e
A nick' sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, kitten? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown kittens? (Ha!)
What's a brick from an outta-town kitten
When you flood and you can drown kittens? (Yughck!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams,
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's
'Cause we can't get along, no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 3 1 2
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire, ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that bod
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G.O.D
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!
And all my kittens say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
I don't know but I've been told (I don't know but I've been told)
If you get fresh get all the hoes (If you get fresh get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes (I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes (Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my kittens say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my ladies say "G.O.O.D. Music!"
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
Who runnin' shit today? G.O.O.D. Music!
[Hook]
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
Not enough time in one lifetime
To love you like you deserve
[Verse 1]

[Verse 3]
Walla boom mena

Days of the (?)
Money done side
Paper lined up all fallin'
And they linin club poppin'
And they down to throw
I'm just zonin'
Eh... nah
Actin' like purple salt
I've been on that rhyme till I get it now
Puffin up
Making money
Grindin paper
Make it witch you
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real kitten back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more kittens off than Cochran, huh?
On sight, on sight
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncing
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
On sight, on sight
Uh-huh
Right now, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need right now
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til it's over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming no no no, no no
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
[Chorus]
So keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Keeping ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown
Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
Were just wasting time, wheres the finish line
[Chorus]
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
If I'll be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
[Chorus]
Oh, you didn't think we can do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from po pimping to poppin' tags
From Chunkiest to Slow Jamz, oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on
Why don't we, play something these hoes'd like
Drive whips, I know they like
Twista, you told her right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice, like Kobe right
We sorta like Goldie right
The way, we mode 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Girl I see you, in them apple bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon, O-four range
Still sexy, when you smoke that flame
Jerk you like a chicken, when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven, the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good girl but you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my, my, my, my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at one O six and park
I can see your beauty, on the big screen
I can see me freaking you, with whip cream
I can see you on stage, at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's, and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right

[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey 
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
[Kanye:]
My homey Mali used to stay one 29th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day 
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin 16 he was stuntin
Al B Sure kitten with the hair all wavy
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy 
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car 
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
And there was a lot of flirting involved 
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow...
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey
[Paul Wall:]
What It do 
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunnk open screens on neons lit with tha 5th relaxin
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park 
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on a switch sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawlin like a caterlippar 
I'm tippin on those 4's I'm jamming on this screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do?
[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey 
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today 'cause tomorrow man you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
[Kanye:]
My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live 
[GLC:]
And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident 
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on Volks
My cylinder quiet like tip toes 
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow
Chopped and Screwed 
Yeah..
Drive slow homey 
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey 
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
[Intro]
Stutterin'
Givin'em rest and makin' love again
In my best I be the run again
And I have the man dem stutterin'
[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this kitten in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefin just too long when
He see me in the evenin'
Want to catch all these feelin
Well let me be the first to get mine
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittin'and countin', smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my kittens watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling ''What up?''
The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, kitten we armed, trust me bruh
They yellin' Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryin' to see through the mist of it
Could have been livin' it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate
[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair
Yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so it's
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In God we trust, the game is all us
Til' the sky calls or it's flames on us
Push
[Hook]
[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
I'm chillin' in my camo, flippin' through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo
Ammunition I'm pitchin' to make your body switch another position
[Verse 5: CyHi da Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickelin' when I hear what haters be whisperin'
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some kittens in?
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ain't never flip the
Nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card
[Break: D'banj (Kanye West, Kid Cudi)]
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelin' on top now, getting that money kitten?
(Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aw man, made something from nothing)
[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would've been God except I added more o's
If I knew she was cheatin' I'd still've bought her more clothes
'Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallin' for
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontin'
God damn, we made something from nothing

All day, kitten
It's Ye, kitten
Shopping for the winter
It's just May, kitten
Ball so hard, man
This shit cray, kitten
You ain't getting money unless you got eight figures
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like kitten you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a kitten in a coop/coupe
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
All of the lights (All of the lights)
(Lights, lights) All of the lights 
Turn up the lights in here baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Fast cars, shooting stars
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
(All of the lights)
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
Something wrong
I hold my head
M.J. gone, our kitten dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a kitten replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university (All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night (All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, Grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please,
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university (All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night (All of the lights)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these kittens know, yeah
Get it right, eh
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these kittens know, yeah
Get it right, eh
You should go and get your own
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind? (My mind, my mind, my mind)
And also was about to do that line (Line, line, line)
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time (Time)
We going all the way this time (Time)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
Turn up the lights in here, baby

You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
Whoa, whoa, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say
It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)
I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem
That'll never
Ever be solved
And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'
Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
[Chorus]
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
I'm amazin'
Yeah I'm all that
If i ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?
Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive for victory
Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!
I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon
That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms
They like oh god!
why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' [Repeat: x3]
Kanye West:

So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit

But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gonna do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And will do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger

Man I've been waiting all night now

Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

It don't really matter what you do
Still, never feel doubt about you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
Still never feel doubt about you
A b c d e f
We picking up right where we left out
And I took a reassess
When I get back you going to take that off
In the mural I hate me, state me
I make money
Money don't make me
Hey honey what do you take me for
Don't look at me like I'm crazy
Don't ever think daddy faze me
You ain't fit to do that
You ain't crazy
You ain't built like that
Hey baby what it feel like
Just forget I said it, screw it
It don't really matter what you do when you do it
It don't really matter what you do
It don't matter baby
Baby I don't want to be in your shoes
It don't really matter what you do
Still, never feel doubt about you

Hey baby what it feel like
Just forget I said it, screw it
It don't really matter what you do when you do it
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
Didn't you know
I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone
When I heard the news
[Chorus]
When you decide to break the rules
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
People will talk
Like its old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you
How long have you known too
You played it off and act like he's brand new
[Chorus]
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Oh you just gonna
Keep another no you wont
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
Oh you just gonna
Keep another love for you
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream
That'll never come true
Oh you just gonna
Keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone
When I heard the news
Whats on the news
Channel cruise
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
We outta here baby!
"Dude!" Fresh off the plane, "konichiwa," bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say "he going crazy and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
kitten please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs: you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby!
Wha, wha, we outta here baby!
Hey Mr. West we so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant "have them," I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant "havoc"
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch
We outta here baby!
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
I know what it's like to feel down little girl
I hope someone lifts you up like the big guy who lifted me up
No, I'm talkin about the big guy right here: Cleveland Brown
Not long ago I was lower than Lohan
No plan, a lost man, raisin my little girl in a Cadillac Brougham
My quest success, but my life was a mess
Poor Kenny West, no zest, antidepressed
Not dressed to impress
Matter fact more stressed
Than John Mayer waiting on his AIDS test
Then I met a man who taught me how to live large
Took me out of my car
Now I'm in his garage
Turns out all I needed was some inspiration
Like Mr. Miagi but a lot less Asian
My game was timid now my flow much bolder
Got a chubby brown angel sittin on my shoulder, sayin
(Girl singing)
You know, it don't matter what you do
Cuz I'll always be there for you
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Grow a mustache
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Slap your wife's ass
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Never smoke grass
Be-Cleve in yourself
[Cleveland:] Really pass gas
Be-Cleve in yourself! Goodnight!
Stadium status
Uh
My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin
Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Copin iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out, yell out
You know the name, do gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib
Big brother was Big's Brother
Used to be Dame and Big's Brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big Brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Big's brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client, the presidito, Hola Hovito
The game getting foul, so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1, I'm a beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, its give and go
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo
Y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Cold Play
Next thing I know he got a song with Cold Play
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate español
No way Jose
Then I went and told J Brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man, should of told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was Big's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could still smell um
A idol in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city, Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother
My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.D's friend
No I.D my mentor, and that's where the story ends
Don't kill this shit
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I’ve been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These kittens ain't doin' shit
Them kittens ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You kittens ain't breathing you gasping
These kittens ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit's about to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
God, God, God, God!
God, God, God, God!

Think you could probably do something for the kids for graduation to sing?
This was founded years ago 
By broke slaves, years ago 
Who did not have, years ago 
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago 
Who did not have when we could not eat 
Hmm, remember that? 
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm? 
Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh? 
Remember that?
[Quietly]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)

Broke, broke, broke phi- 
Leader: I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us.
There is an imposter among us.
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has.
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!
Kanye:(stammering) I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-
Leader: No, you speak up, brother!
Kanye: I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-
Leader: What?
Kanye: I wanna stick to my roots, and-
Leader: What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.
Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like that, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.

Bust somebody head, TLC, where was we?
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
kittens out in Georgetown, and Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, south
Side of the broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort, the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the grip with conflict diamonds and the arts
Back in '94 they call me Chi-Town's Nas
Now them kittens know I'm one of Chi-Town's gods
We even yo, you still talking no cops
A conscious kitten with mac like Steven Jobs
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside side of the Chi
Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open, I think I know why
I'm back from the future, seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like two dimes
People asking him, "Do you have any gray poupon?"
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside, side of the Chi
You in the building but the building's falling
You wouldn't be balling if your name is Spalding
My mind get flooded, I think about New Orleans
Back in school, y'all kittens, you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside 'bout to walk it out, I still get crawling
If rap was Harlem, I'd be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G Rap, we're calling
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
With kittens masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait 'til they say, "Yeah, he ran up at the Oscars"
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans don't love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, holla
We some true Chi-Town legends, accept no [Incomprehensible]
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
The un-American Idol, Tower like the Eiffel
'Lean Wit it, Rock Wit It', black like the Disciples
Know when to use a Bible and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Things' like Spike do
Through conflicts is crucial and trauma is psycho
We coming from the
Southside, southside
Southside, southside
Southside, southside, southside of the Chi
We're coming from the

You might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up, take your life and

CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest
Ahh!, come on we gone party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Stand up! stand up!
Stand up! stand up!
[Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, "get down!"
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack "The Tripper"
My kitten Tony been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real rolex it don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks Red Hot like Anthony Kiedis
To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Hovah get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins
Chorus
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (yeah)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (uh)
Stand up! (just like that?)

[Ludacris]
How you ain't gone FUCK?, bitch I'm me
I'm the GOD DAMN reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
[Chorus: Ludacris + Shawnna]
[Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late

Baddest bitch in the States, half Spanish half Trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y'all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can't afford to be a minute late
It's time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plates my crotch
That soft as tater top, lil' kitten try me not

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand dollar jeans
Your girl a Queen, my girl a thing
You know what though? I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
[Kanye West:]
I'm a take this one for the team
GOOD music
Yeah you know what
I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples crib's smell like shit
I hate when I leave, I smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up baby I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God-damn cucumber bath and body works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water that shit probably worse
Is he a classic like the Ladi Dadi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Ooooh, that shit gotta hurt
[Chorus: Pusha T]
[Pusha T:]
Nevermind me, 'Ye have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
kitten hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's jeans on a jackass
And my bitch got on tights with a tac ass
I'm a fly kitten and I carry on
With the bottles of that Rose and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carry's on
Dookie chain and a herringbone
Real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights baby that's a field trip
Double date don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
Ladies and gentleman
It's G.O.O.D music in the house
And we got Keri
[Keri Hilson:]
All I know you the one that I heard about
Know you work your way up through word of mouth
Plus I'm a have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
(I like your mentality baby)
[Cyhi The Prynce:]
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar
I'm playing with her kitty later come in the car
She a red bone but her cousin is dark
A little out of shape but you'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying fuck, she talking she wanna eat first
I'm like why did this bitch have to bring her
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I can sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said I gotta chick for you that'd like a singer
On a scale of 1-10 she's a 15′er
Meaner, shoulda seen a kitten face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
Though on my team she will be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one and the beamer
I'm the point guard and I need wing... 
[Keri Hilson:]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
GOOD Friday's, 
It's the kitten they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date

We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out

And I bet I'm gon sweat her Vidal Sassoon out

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
What'd you hear this time
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And the whole hood's buzzin'
Then he said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Somethin' that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, hey, hey
They ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
(When they don't know)
When they don't know one thing about
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
I swear they got some nerve
Spreading what they heard
I can't give them no words
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved, that's my word
See I'm not the one 
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do 
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
(Hey, hey)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
(Baby)
How can they talk about our love
(Why you talkin' about me)
When they don't know one thing about 
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
Kanye....
[Kanye's rap verse]
Here's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
I'm wonderin' why she "ret to go" like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I'll trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember when I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said; "You so nuts!"
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why
[chorus]
The more they talk about our love
(The more they talk about our love)
The more they make it obvious
the more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
(People shouldn't talk about us!)
When they don't know one thing about 
(Us) (No)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So) (Whoo!)
All we do is tune them out
Go on...ohh...
The more they talk about our love
(Tune it out baby)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
(Woo, woo, heeey)
How can they talk about our love?
(Let's not talk about it baby)
When they don't know one thing about
(Us)
And then they just runnin' they mouths
(So)
All we do is tune them out
I don't wanna hear it no more...
Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My kittenz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me "don't touch me"
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
kittenz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my kittenz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said "I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes"
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said "Ye' you don't love me"
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
I do it for the fore-fathers and the street authors
That are not A&R's in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now there's crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy they don't know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
No Electro, no metro, a little retro, I perfecto
You know the demo, ya boy act wild
You ain't get the memo, Yeezy's back in style
Now when Rome go Gidget the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out though is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they sisters
They momma, named them after white bitches
No next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the Jewerly's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like "Is he gon' be dope again?"
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?
This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed, well mine's an obscenity
Add a little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
This is my momma shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood 
When I was back in my pajama shit
Afro's and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja hat 
Will be popping like the sample that I'm rhyming with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I don't needle pop
Taking sips of pop, six packs of millanips
Pink champel, Valentine L
Bally's on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's
Virgin Mary's try to judge her, I'm like "where the Madonna's now?"
Give all glory to Gloria, they said "you raised that boy too fast, 
But you was raising a warrior"
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
Don't let them take your fire
Keep you hands up, get mine up
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you, but I need you, 
I love you and I hate you at the very same time 
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad 
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said 
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says 
God talk to me now this is an emergency 
And she claim she only with me for the currency, 
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery 
And I was to proud to admit that it was hurtin me 
I'd never do that to you at least purposely 
We breakin up again we makin up again 
But we don't love no more 
I guess we fuckin then 
Have you ever felt like you wanted to kill her 
And you mixed them emotions with tequilla 
And you mixed that with a little bad advice 
On one of them bad nights 
You have a bad fight 
And you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit 
And she sayin muhfucka yo mama's a bitch 
You know domestic drama and shit 
All the attitude 
Ill never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you 
But im a be the bigger man 
Big pimpin like jigga man 
Oh i figure it's 
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me 
I don't want you, but I need you, 
I love you and I hate you at the very same time 
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad 
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said 
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says 
God talk to me now this is an emergency 
And my kitten says I shouldn't let her worry me 
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently 
But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it 
This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now 
This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me 
And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny 
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually 
Cause every time that I try you will question me 
Say "you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me? 
You don't see how your lies are affecting me? 
You don't see how our life was supposed to be? 
And I never let a kitten get that close to me! 
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be! 
You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be!" 
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me! 
I fucked up and I know it G 
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique, any street
If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress
Father is the black Bruce Wayne, only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains
Tryna hand feed us tell the kittens to anty up
We not off no more, pearlies in a show, fur
So pick your auntie up, I gotta run to that pole
What a world that I'm livin' in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I feel my path narrow I run again
See happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em gray clouds up above, man
Metaphor to my life, man
Still I feel my heart stronger then it's ever been
Strong will to my journey ends
'Til then I roll more then I've ever rolled
Not pills but the marioll
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go
Nothing helping with my head dose
But I ain't sleepin', awake in another state
Livin' in a new space
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
'Til then I call
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on, come on
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Grey clouds took together fam
Lining piercing to another land
Over the desert wit' the lost play
Soul searching each in every way
An then you see the
Awesome sounds so profound within it'll grip you
You can see it if you hear, you can feel it too
Somethin' special I am runnin' to
'Til then I go away, very far away
To another universe where all people say
It's a new, new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian you seein' it wandered out the place
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful
Even if you dry you'll be floatin' high above it
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Come on, come on
The sky might fall, the sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey, I let 'em know some
I let 'em know some, I let 'em know some
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up
Yeah, gotta keep up, gotta keep up
And I keep runnin', yeah, I gotta keep up, gotta keep up
Yeah, gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone, yeah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm up and away, na, na, na, na
You know what I'm about? Hey, hey

[Luther Vandross]
Are you gonna be 
Say that you're gonna be

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh...
[Jamie Foxx - Chorus]
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right 
(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)
[Kanye West]
I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring da cool whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home
Man I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action
My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
I'm a play this Vandross 
You gon' take your pants off
Imma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get right
[Chorus X2]
[Twista]
Got you lookin at the gliss at my hands and wrists
While i'm layin back smokin on my canibus
When it come to rockin the rythm like Marvin and Luther 
I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be
Sippin Hennessy
Play some R&B
Tryina smoke a B
Lookin properly
Feelin on a G?
And always (Well Well Well Well Well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm
Smokin on a B
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B
And I got to leave
Something to the 23's?
And I do it (well well well well well)
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl 
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me
[chorus X2]
[Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
'cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
'cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin' 
Tryina make you moan
And I do it (well well well well well)
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers
Different DNA, they don't understand you
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic
You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
There is this transcendental, on another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me 
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Ahh!
Bitch I'm a monster no good blood sucker
Fat motherfucker now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, here's one for example
Gossip gossip

Don't matter who you go and get, ain't nobody as cold as this
Do the rap and the track triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard the beat the same raps that give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi kitten but these hos love my accent
She came up to me and said this the number two dial
If you wanna make it number one your number two now
This that goose an' Malibu I call it Maliboomyauh!
God damn Yeezy how I hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker well, what you gon' do now
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
Nah gonna do, uh its a new now
Think yo motherfucker really real need to cool out
Cause you will never get on top off this
So mommy best advice is to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh

Now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallow-ship
I'm living the future so the presence is my past
My presence is a present kiss my ass

Nonsense none of you  kittens know where the swamp is
None of you kittens have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still here fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles

Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles heel is
Love! I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these kittens I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip gossip

With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

OK first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
Young money is the roster and the monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake I ain't notice cause my money ain't!
So let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
Fifty K for a verse no album out!
Yeah my money's so tall that my barbies gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate
Find it, Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it 
How these kittens so one-track minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget barbie fuck Nicki she's fake
She's on a diet but my pockets eating cheese cake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is Child's play
Just killed another career it's a mild day
Besides Ye they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am' should menage Friday
Pink wig thick ass give 'em whip lash
I think big get cash make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw I think this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster!
I-I crossed the limelight
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home
I-I crossed the limelight
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home

Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So won't you hook a chew scorns, she tellin you buy

And I wear no Escalade, metallic, black or beige
Yo when I walk up in the club you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy he got something to say
[Kanye West]
Aiiyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
And where the glocks don't jam, so where we pop them scrams
See I showed you on the champions how we get down
So don't twist ya lips, I'm like Bobby Brown
You got B2K on all your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan, gonna work ya walls
Straight from the South side of dem Chi-town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats
[Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiiyo I take you out
Either with the nine or the tech's in his mouth
And let that dime gettin friendly than the orgie's at eight
But y'all kittenz don't shine so you couldn't relate
[Chorus]
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Yo Quence, you couldn't relate)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down
[Consequence]
Quence without the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You starin at my Rolls' cold way to long
But I ain't scared of robbers, why I wear tephlon
I took her on the ave and she expect me to trip
But I made up with no style while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama holler at ya boy
[Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
'Cause it don't look like a thug or a hood
But he keep dem gorilla's so we still be good
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
and the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'ma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when kittenz leave the city and switch up they reps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'ma milk the game, 'til we all can eat
[Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zonin for a couple of weeks
[Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show 
'Cause that's the best way to get a kitten with dough 
Then fake a pregnancy, then call the attorney-a 
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture 
[Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and 'em Puffs from L.B
They know the Consequence be wearin gold and ice
'Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Ey shorty let me tell you 'bout the rules of my Nikes
It seems they always keep on movin, I don't hear nuthin twice
[Chorus]
So relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down (Don't hear nuthin twice)
Relax yourself or we'll whack ya down

All day long man, we back in town
[Repeat 'til end]
Relax yaself or we'll whack ya down
"I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
and the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
to choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
HOOK: I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
to put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
she gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
in and out I'm movin through her student body union and
she, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
she said, I aint no fool I make it up in summer school
HOOK:

Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Heh, who you lovin, who you wanna be fuckin

spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
tend to hurries in ten places at once
plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
and some day I slow down, but for now I get around
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
or caine and O-dog, stick up tape from menace
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my buisness
HOOK:

And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream

But still, K-A-N-Y-E
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free

Feel the bump when we grind
My uh in is your body, my uh is in your mind
Check my dictionary that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knocked and I knocked uh, can I come inside?
I knocked and I knocked girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between your thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good that type of stuff you can't explain
I do what I do to do to make it rain
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad you came
'Cause you the type that danger we gain in yo
Mic check like the way I begin my show
Girl I come from Chica so 'n' I go
Turn around, it's about to be a TKO
Hey baby, am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Some call me Com, Com, some call me The Red, Red
You can call me daddy, I'ma put you to bed
An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed
The sexual eruption got you hitting your head
On the board and knock and screaming, oh Lord
We exchange like students 'cause I study abroad
And listen to your body and low key party
And I keep pushing and pushing, you 'bout to volley em' up
We the type to make lovin' and we up
We take a ride down south 'cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was saving it up
I'm the doctor, I can hold it till my patience is up
I make, I make, I make you hot baby
I know, I know, I know your spot baby
When we do it like we don't want it to end
It's 3 P.M., we gon' do it again
Hey baby, am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Hey baby am I crazy or was you giving me the eye?
You said maybe? Well you crazy because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly, yeah I know what you like
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me
Come on girl, let's go to distant lands unknown
We can fly on air if love is everywhere for you and me

You
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night, like she on patrol
Checkin' everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh
[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, drop it, drop it
Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When did you become a robocop
No, I don't need a robocop
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh oh
[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no robocop
You movin' like a robocop
When you become a robocop
Somebody please make it stop
Stop, drop, roll, pop
Bitch, I'm cold,
Ain't use to being, told stop
So I can never be your Robot
Fast or slow
You can stay, you can go
Now that you know, now that you know
Yea I had her before, but that happened before
You get mad when you know
Soldiers don't ask me no more
[Chorus]
Okay
Okay
Okay (hey hey)
[Intro]

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
I've been so laid out
I've been so far gone
I've been so damn gone
I've been runnin' 'round
I've been on my shit
Whole world on my dick
I just need to know
[Bridge]

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't want to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't want to stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my kittens from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my kittens ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
All these things
(Ad libs)
Yo Hip-Hop Is kittenz still talkin bout I can't rap Come On Now
Look for me Young K
Took Tupac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust kitten ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom
That I call my lair
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
That's Right (Kanye)
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
Look for me
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
[Jay-Z] Yep!
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous
I'm so appalled Spalding ball,
Baldin' Donald Trump, takin' dollars from y'all
Baby your fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' whole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin'
That know we get O's like cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Will be the same day M.T.V. play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby I'm magic ta-da
Address me as your highness, high as united
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
kittens be writin' bullshit like they gotta work
kittens is goin' through real shit man they outta work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I rather spit somethin' that gotta purp'
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit if fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
How should I begin this, I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show kittens how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my draws
Dark knight feelin', die you be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite, to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'ye already told you we major you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
The hammer went and broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mill so spent another thirty
Cause unlike hammer thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playin'
All these little bitches, too big for their britches
Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
I mean the shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
Success is what you make it
Take it how it come
A half a mill in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
C.N.N. said I'd be dead by twenty one
Blackjack I just pulled in Aces
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream motherfuckers I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just the young rich kitten that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes comin' in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was wit' me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it don't effect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Those kilo's came we give you bobby brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin' I own you all, yeughck!
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!
Huh, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If god had an Ipod I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazing, the faces and places the favorite
My cup over runeth with hundreths
Dummy damn its hard not for me to waste it
The new commandment
Though should not hate kid
My movement is like the Civil Rights I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I ain't nothing like those kittens baby those are marks
I met this girl on valentines day
Fucked her in May, she found out about April
So she chose to March, Ha
Damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by them two's kitten, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me
I call my dro' Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the path finder
Cause you haters got P.H.D's
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger woods don't make me grab iron
Champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Calls from the Mrs.
Infers from the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous, fuckin' ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Two hands in the air, if he don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, the shit ridiculous
One hand in the air, if he don't really care
Middle Finger in the air, if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh!
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blacky
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the "No Smoking" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never wanna to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule headset nine
Puttin' them pants shelves
Waitin' patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed and count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
A and R's and their faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this grave shift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride
[Samuel Christian] 
You ready?
[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing
[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks
[Chorus: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not run from an-y-thing
I swear this though
[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time
[Chorus]
[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate 
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...
[Chorus] - repeat until fade
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got "-Ye" but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up the base line recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but never brokin' through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
'Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us treat us like we almost white
Almost
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
kittenz wanna diss K
On they're local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya
A little arrogant with all your compares
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
When you walk straight, kittenz tend to look at you sideways
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way
kittenz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars, all better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
I did it my way
Yeah
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, "Behold the Pale, Horse"
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it
"Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them repo'd, resold then redriven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin'
It's plain to see, kittens can't fuck with me
'cause I'm a be that kitten for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
kitten I'm home on these charts, y'all kittens visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now kittenz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where kittens praise Yukons and getting paid
Its goin' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryin' to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get 
Get up, I get down
Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin' well
Somebody must have caught him 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums what I got, like four of 'em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin' Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin' them lyrics kittens get very religious
Six hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all kittens
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin' legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody want to be Hov and Hov's still alive
Yeah, grandmama
Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
I know you'll neva let me down

I see the we poe, we sold then we driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot I'm hot and when my feet cold mines is sizzelin'
It's plain to see, kitten's can't fuck wit me
'Cuz I'ma be that kitten fo life, this is not an image
This is got given, this is hard liven
Mixed wit crystall sippin', it's the most consistent
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found

Who's fault
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure
As a last resort, and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing harvesting the feelings, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about 2 A.M. and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself
Somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you 
In a bathroom gripping you up and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other, kitten's is stroking you
Might say I hit you
He sitting there consoling you
Rubbing my name threw the mud
Who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a kitten like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable like can't nobody get control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever you gon' told him too
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't you're right girl
You probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing
Whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to the nother motherfuckin' level!
Now a neighborhood kitten 
Like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, Goddamn! Who thought you how to get sexy for a kitten?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you, motheruckin' butt ass naked, with them, Jimmy Choos on
Who thought you how to put some Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy thought me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now shit!
You done went all porno on a kitten OK
And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy thought me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I never fucked before
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
Who the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that kitten I'ma thank him
I'ma buy his album
I'ma download that motherfucker I'ma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this kitten
Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
You went to bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source
I remember! Twista had this on in The Source
That's right, that's right! 
Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a kitten like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it
We could've been somebody
Instead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happening
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
Fuck them other kittens cause I'm down with my kittens
I ride with my kittens, I'll die for my
To all my second string bitches, tryna get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy

He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony, uh, yeah yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'Til death but do your part, uh, unholy matrimony
Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass

And your girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is goin' give me a Tylenol
You put a kitten to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy

He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was practicing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child 'cause now y'all

It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass

We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it

To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!

Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang

Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
If spring can take the snow away 
(If spring can take the snow away) 
Can it melt away all of our mistakes 
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again 
Never again
I love it though
I love it though
Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a kitten did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
May the Lord forgive us
May the God's be with us
And that magic hour
I seen good Christians 
Make brash decisions
Oh she do it, 
What happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up
She casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wantedt, huh?"
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime
Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
(Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a kitten did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation
When the sun go down its the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said "you are what you eat"
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phoney
Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, kitten shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real kitten, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings never stumble retracin' my steps
It was all good just a week ago
kittens feel they selves 
And then Watch The Throne drop
kittens kill they selves
What kittens gon' do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
kittens tellin' me "You back" (you back)
Like a kitten ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way kitten, you should fuckin' quit, kitten
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam kitten
Goin' HAM kitten, me and Jigga
And a kitten still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a kitten glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all mothafuckers woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
kittens fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi kitten
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with kittens
kittens ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
kittens took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
Head shots kitten fuck your vests
Fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God 'cause you know a kitten just went Ham
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard as a mothafucker let these kittens know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM

Album:  College Dropout Unreleased
Song:   DreamKillers
[Chorus 1]
They gossipin, it runs the city, they don't know who watchin them 
When they comin to get me, so I hit the block and bend
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like blaow blaow blaow
[Verse 1]
Im finna to get on this TV and put shit down
I aint finna let these lights skinned kittenz come back in style
Im finna turn to this class clown, shit to crazy g's
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D.
I told em, w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners
Old folks said he‘d never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold
That get green on ya, when you get green on em
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em
Somebody told success is the best revenge
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support
 
[Chorus 2]
They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Who know a dream, uh they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
[Verse 2]
Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'cause we the leaders, and they the followers
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit dog, and they the flies
How you gon tell me how to live my life
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right
They are the misery that loves company
'cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said “Oh you graduated?” No I decided I was finished
Chasin yall dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up
Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya
Come around wit ya but they aint down wit ya
They the dreamkillers
[Verse 3]
And I'm through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow
They be like “That's cool, you got some beats for me tho”
Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a FUCK what you got to say
Anyway what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even takin wages in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon be like “Peace”
This kitten came from the Chi, moved to the east
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York, what you aint never took a tour there?
What you aint know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dreamkillers
